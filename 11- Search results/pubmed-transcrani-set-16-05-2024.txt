AB  - BACKGROUND: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common, disabling symptom of Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), but the mechanisms and treatments of FOG remain great challenges 
      for clinicians and researchers. The main focus of this review is to summarize the 
      possible mechanisms underlying FOG, the risk factors for screening and predicting 
      the onset of FOG, and the clinical trials involving various therapeutic 
      strategies. In addition, the limitations and recommendations for future research 
      design are also discussed. MAIN BODY: In the mechanism section, we briefly 
      introduced the physiological process of gait control and hypotheses about the 
      mechanism of FOG. In the risk factor section, gait disorders, PIGD phenotype, 
      lower striatal DAT uptake were found to be independent risk factors of FOG with 
      consistent evidence. In the treatment section, we summarized the clinical trials 
      of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. Despite the limited 
      effectiveness of current medications for FOG, especially levodopa resistant FOG, 
      there were some drugs that showed promise such as istradefylline and rasagiline. 
      Non-pharmacological treatments encompass invasive brain and spinal cord 
      stimulation, noninvasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or 
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), 
      and physiotherapeutic approaches including cues and other training strategies. 
      Several novel therapeutic strategies seem to be effective, such as rTMS over 
      supplementary motor area (SMA), dual-site DBS, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and 
      VNS. Of physiotherapy, wearable cueing devices seem to be generally effective and 
      promising. CONCLUSION: FOG model hypotheses are helpful for better understanding 
      and characterizing FOG and they provide clues for further research exploration. 
      Several risk factors of FOG have been identified, but need combinatorial 
      optimization for predicting FOG more precisely. Although firm conclusions cannot 
      be drawn on therapeutic efficacy, the literature suggested that some therapeutic 
      strategies showed promise.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive 
      neuromodulation technique. When stimulation is applied over the primary motor 
      cortex and coupled with electromyography measures, TMS can probe functions of 
      cortical excitability and plasticity in vivo. The purpose of this meta-analysis 
      is to evaluate the utility of TMS-derived measures for differentiating patients 
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from 
      cognitively normal older adults (CN). METHODS: Databases searched included 
      PubMed, Embase, APA PsycInfo, Medline, and CINAHL Plus from inception to July 
      2021. RESULTS: Sixty-one studies with a total of 2728 participants (1454 patients 
      with AD, 163 patients with MCI, and 1111 CN) were included. Patients with AD 
      showed significantly higher cortical excitability, lower cortical inhibition, and 
      impaired cortical plasticity compared to the CN cohorts. Patients with MCI 
      exhibited increased cortical excitability and reduced plasticity compared to the 
      CN cohort. Additionally, lower cognitive performance was significantly associated 
      with higher cortical excitability and lower inhibition. No seizure events due to 
      TMS were reported, and the mild adverse response rate is approximately 3/1000 
      (i.e., 9/2728). CONCLUSIONS: Findings of our meta-analysis demonstrate the 
      potential of using TMS-derived cortical excitability and plasticity measures as 
      diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD and MCI.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a safe and noninvasive means of 
      electrically stimulating the brain by electromagnetic induction. TMS is capable 
      of probing intracortical circuits and modulating cortical activity in humans; as 
      such it has been instrumental to studying the neurophysiology and functional 
      neuroanatomy of the frontal lobes. For example, using TMS to induce "virtual 
      lesions"-transient disruption of function in the targeted brain region-has 
      yielded important insights into the functional organization of the prefrontal 
      cortex (PFC) with respect to working memory, language, and other core cognitive 
      functions. Whereas neuroimaging is typically limited to observing correlations 
      between brain function and behavior, TMS, by interacting with neural circuits, 
      can lead to causal inferences that bridge human, nonhuman primate, and other 
      model system studies. Applied repetitively in trains of stimuli, TMS is also 
      capable of normalizing aberrant patterns of cortical activity in the treatment of 
      neurologic and psychiatric disorders. The earliest and most well-established 
      clinical use of repetitive TMS is in the treatment of medication-resistant 
      depression with high-frequency stimulation of the left dorsolateral PFC. Research 
      efforts to identify other promising clinical applications-such as for stroke and 
      Alzheimer's disease-are rapidly expanding; however, the majority of these 
      indications have yet to have devices cleared by the FDA for on-label use.

TI  - Novel Therapeutic Approaches for Alzheimer's Disease: An Updated Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22158208 [doi]
LID - 8208
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and accounts 
      for most cases of dementia. The prevalence of AD has increased in the current 
      rapidly aging society and contributes to a heavy burden on families and society. 
      Despite the profound impact of AD, current treatments are unable to achieve 
      satisfactory therapeutic effects or stop the progression of the disease. Finding 
      novel treatments for AD has become urgent. In this paper, we reviewed novel 
      therapeutic approaches in five categories: anti-amyloid therapy, anti-tau 
      therapy, anti-neuroinflammatory therapy, neuroprotective agents including 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulators, and brain stimulation. The trend 
      of therapeutic development is shifting from a single pathological target to a 
      more complex mechanism, such as the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative 
      processes. While drug repositioning may accelerate pharmacological development, 
      non-pharmacological interventions, especially repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), also have 
      the potential for clinical application. In the future, it is possible for 
      physicians to choose appropriate interventions individually on the basis of 
      precision medicine.

AB  - Attempts to enhance human memory and learning ability have a long tradition in 
      science. This topic has recently gained substantial attention because of the 
      increasing percentage of older individuals worldwide and the predicted rise of 
      age-associated cognitive decline in brain functions. Transcranial brain 
      stimulation methods, such as transcranial magnetic (TMS) and transcranial 
      electric (tES) stimulation, have been extensively used in an effort to improve 
      cognitive functions in humans. Here we summarize the available data on 
      low-intensity tES for this purpose, in comparison to repetitive TMS and some 
      pharmacological agents, such as caffeine and nicotine. There is no single area in 
      the brain stimulation field in which only positive outcomes have been reported. 
      For self-directed tES devices, how to restrict variability with regard to 
      efficacy is an essential aspect of device design and function. As with any 
      technique, reproducible outcomes depend on the equipment and how well this is 
      matched to the experience and skill of the operator. For self-administered 
      non-invasive brain stimulation, this requires device designs that rigorously 
      incorporate human operator factors. The wide parameter space of non-invasive 
      brain stimulation, including dose (e.g., duration, intensity (current density), 
      number of repetitions), inclusion/exclusion (e.g., subject's age), and 
      homeostatic effects, administration of tasks before and during stimulation, and, 
      most importantly, placebo or nocebo effects, have to be taken into account. The 
      outcomes of stimulation are expected to depend on these parameters and should be 
      strictly controlled. The consensus among experts is that low-intensity tES is 
      safe as long as tested and accepted protocols (including, for example, dose, 
      inclusion/exclusion) are followed and devices are used which follow established 
      engineering risk-management procedures. Devices and protocols that allow 
      stimulation outside these parameters cannot claim to be "safe" where they are 
      applying stimulation beyond that examined in published studies that also 
      investigated potential side effects. Brain stimulation devices marketed for 
      consumer use are distinct from medical devices because they do not make medical 
      claims and are therefore not necessarily subject to the same level of regulation 
      as medical devices (i.e., by government agencies tasked with regulating medical 
      devices). Manufacturers must follow ethical and best practices in marketing tES 
      stimulators, including not misleading users by referencing effects from human 
      trials using devices and protocols not similar to theirs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the most harmful form of dementia in the 
      elderly population. At present, there are no effective treatments and this is 
      likely due to the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology. Recent data 
      indicate that synaptic dysfunction could be a central element of AD 
      pathophysiology. It was found that a synaptic breakdown is an early event that 
      heralds neuronal degeneration. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been 
      recently introduced as a novel approach to identify the early signatures of 
      synaptic dysfunction characterizing AD pathophysiology. In this chapter, we 
      review the new neurophysiologic signatures of AD that have been emphasized by TMS 
      studies. We show how TMS measurement of neuroplasticity identified long-term 
      potentiation (LTP)-like cortical plasticity as a key element of AD synaptic 
      dysfunction. These measurements are useful to increase the accuracy of 
      differential diagnosis, predict disease progression, and anticipate response to 
      therapy. Moreover, enhancing neuroplasticity holds as a promising therapeutic 
      approach to improve cognition in AD. In recent years, studies showed treatments 
      with multiple sessions of rTMS can influence cognition in people with 
      neurodegenerative diseases. In the second part of this chapter, we also consider 
      novel therapeutic approaches based on the clinical use of rTMS.

AB  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has widespread use in research and 
      clinical application. For psychiatric applications, such as depression or OCD, 
      repetitive TMS protocols (rTMS) are an established and globally applied treatment 
      option. While promising, rTMS is not yet as common in treating neurological 
      diseases, except for neurorehabilitation after (motor) stroke and neuropathic 
      pain treatment. This may soon change. New clinical studies testing the potential 
      of rTMS in various other neurological conditions appear at a rapid pace. This can 
      prove challenging for both practitioners and clinical researchers. Although most 
      of these neurological applications have not yet received the same level of 
      scientific/empirical scrutiny as motor stroke and neuropathic pain, the results 
      are encouraging, opening new doors for TMS in neurology. We here review the 
      latest clinical evidence for rTMS in pioneering neurological applications 
      including movement disorders, Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, 
      epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and disorders of consciousness.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique for focal 
      brain stimulation based on electromagnetic induction where a fluctuating magnetic 
      field induces a small intracranial electric current in the brain. For more than 
      35 years, TMS has shown promise in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological 
      and psychiatric disorders in adults. In this review, we provide a brief 
      introduction to the TMS technique with a focus on repetitive TMS (rTMS) 
      protocols, particularly theta-burst stimulation (TBS), and relevant rTMS-derived 
      metrics of brain plasticity. We then discuss the TMS-EEG technique, the use of 
      neuronavigation in TMS, the neural substrate of TBS measures of plasticity, the 
      inter- and intraindividual variability of those measures, effects of age and 
      genetic factors on TBS aftereffects, and then summarize alterations of TMS-TBS 
      measures of plasticity in major neurological and psychiatric disorders including 
      autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, depression, traumatic brain injury, 
      Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. Finally, we discuss the translational studies 
      of TMS-TBS measures of plasticity and their therapeutic implications.

AB  - Depression predisposes to medical illnesses and advances biological aging 
      indicated by shorter telomere length, accelerated brain aging and advanced 
      epigenetic aging. Medical illnesses also increase the risk of late-life 
      depression. The reciprocal relationships of depression with aging-related and 
      disease-related processes have generated pathogenetic hypotheses and provided 
      treatment targets. Targeting risk factors of vascular disease in mid-life is a 
      logical approach in prevention of vascular depression. The depression-executive 
      dysfunction and the vascular depression syndromes have clinical presentations and 
      neuroimaging findings consistent with frontostriatal abnormalities. Dopamine 
      D(2/3) agonists are effective in depression of Parkinson's disease and their 
      efficacy needs to be assessed in these two syndromes. Computerized cognitive 
      remediation targeting functions of the cognitive control network may improve both 
      executive functions and depressive symptoms of late-life major depression. 
      Significant progress has been made in neurostimulation treatments in depressed 
      younger adults. TMS targeting deep structures responsible for mood regulation is 
      well tolerated by older adults and its efficacy in syndromes of late-life 
      depression needs to be studied. Efficacious psychotherapies for late-life 
      depression exist, but are underutilized in part because of their complexity. 
      Streamlined, stepped psychotherapies targeting behaviors assumed to result from 
      dysfunction of brain networks implicated in late-life depression can be easy to 
      learn and have potential for dissemination. However, their effectiveness needs 
      further investigation. Depression increases the risk of dementing disorders. 
      Antidepressants are rather ineffective in treating depression of demented 
      patients, but long-term use of antidepressants may reduce the risk of dementia. 
      However, confirmation studies are needed.

TI  - Efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation on cognitive functioning in brain 
      disorders: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 2465-2486

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognition is commonly affected in brain disorders. Non-invasive brain 
      stimulation (NIBS) may have procognitive effects, with high tolerability. This 
      meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
      and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in improving cognition, in 
      schizophrenia, depression, dementia, Parkinson's disease, stroke, traumatic brain 
      injury, and multiple sclerosis. METHODS: A PRISMA systematic search was conducted 
      for randomized controlled trials. Hedges' g was used to quantify effect sizes 
      (ES) for changes in cognition after TMS/tDCS v. sham. As different cognitive 
      functions may have unequal susceptibility to TMS/tDCS, we separately evaluated 
      the effects on: attention/vigilance, working memory, executive functioning, 
      processing speed, verbal fluency, verbal learning, and social cognition. RESULTS: 
      We included 82 studies (n = 2784). For working memory, both TMS (ES = 0.17, p = 
      0.015) and tDCS (ES = 0.17, p = 0.021) showed small but significant effects. Age 
      positively moderated the effect of TMS. TDCS was superior to sham for 
      attention/vigilance (ES = 0.20, p = 0.020). These significant effects did not 
      differ across the type of brain disorder. Results were not significant for the 
      other five cognitive domains. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that both TMS and 
      tDCS elicit a small trans-diagnostic effect on working memory, tDCS also improved 
      attention/vigilance across diagnoses. Effects on the other domains were not 
      significant. Observed ES were small, yet even slight cognitive improvements may 
      facilitate daily functioning. While NIBS can be a well-tolerated treatment, its 
      effects appear domain specific and should be applied only for realistic 
      indications (i.e. to induce a small improvement in working memory or attention).

AB  - Aging is associated with alterations in cognitive processing and brain 
      neurophysiology. Whereas the primary symptom of amnestic mild cognitive 
      impairment (aMCI) is memory problems greater than normal for age and education, 
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show impairments in other cognitive 
      domains in addition to memory dysfunction. Resting-state electroencephalography 
      (rsEEG) studies in physiological aging indicate a global increase in 
      low-frequency oscillations' power and the reduction and slowing of alpha 
      activity. The enhancement of slow and the reduction of fast oscillations, and the 
      disruption of brain functional connectivity, however, are characterized as major 
      rsEEG changes in AD. Recent rodent studies also support human evidence of age- 
      and AD-related changes in resting-state brain oscillations, and the 
      neuroprotective effect of brain stimulation techniques through gamma-band 
      stimulations. Cumulatively, current evidence moves toward optimizing rsEEG 
      features as reliable predictors of people with aMCI at risk for conversion to AD 
      and mapping neural alterations subsequent to brain stimulation therapies. The 
      present paper reviews the latest evidence of changes in rsEEG oscillations in 
      physiological aging, aMCI, and AD, as well as findings of various brain 
      stimulation therapies from both human and non-human studies.

      A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive 
      form of brain stimulation that positively regulates the motor and non-motor 
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although, most reviews and meta-analysis 
      have shown that rTMS intervention is effective in treating motor symptoms and 
      depression, very few have used randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to analyse the 
      efficacy of this intervention in PD. We aimed to review RCTs of rTMS in patients 
      with PD to assess the efficacy of rTMS on motor and non-motor function in 
      patients with PD. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we 
      searched PubMed, MEDLINE and Web of Science databases for RCTs on rTMS in PD 
      published between January 1, 1988 to January 1, 2022. Eligible studies included 
      sham-controlled RCTs that used rTMS stimulation for motor or non-motor symptoms 
      in PD. RCTs not focusing on the efficacy of rTMS in PD were excluded. Summary 
      data were extracting from those RCTs by two investigators independently. We then 
      calculated standardised mean difference with random-effect models. The main 
      outcome included motor and non-motor examination of scales that were used in PD 
      motor or non-motor assessment. This study was registered with PROSPERO, 
      CRD42022329633. FINDINGS: Fourteen studies with 469 patients met the criteria for 
      our meta-analysis. Twelve eligible studies with 381 patients were pooled to 
      analyse the efficacy of rTMS on motor function improvement. The effect size on 
      motor scale scores was 0.51 (P < 0.0001) and were not distinctly heterogeneous 
      (I(2) = 29%). Five eligible studies with 202 patients were collected to evaluate 
      antidepressant-like effects. The effect size on depression scale scores was 0.42 
      (P = 0.004), and were not distinctly heterogeneous (I(2) = 25%), indicating a 
      significant anti-depressive effect (P = 0.004). The results suggest that 
      high-frequency of rTMS on primary motor cortex (M1) is effective in improving 
      motor symptoms; while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may be a 
      potentially effective area in alleviating depressive symptom. INTERPRETATION: The 
      findings suggest that rTMS could be used as a possible adjuvant therapy for PD 
      mainly to improve motor symptoms, but could have potential efficacy on depressive 
      symptoms of PD. However, further investigation is needed. FUNDING: The National

AB  - Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques (NiBS) have gathered substantial 
      interest in the study of dementia, considered their possible role in help 
      defining diagnostic biomarkers of altered neural activity for early disease 
      detection and monitoring of its pathophysiological course, as well as for their 
      therapeutic potential of boosting residual cognitive functions. Nevertheless, 
      current approaches suffer from some limitations. In this study, we review and 
      discuss experimental NiBS applications that might help improve the efficacy of 
      future NiBS uses in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), including perturbation-based 
      biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease tracking, solutions to enhance 
      synchronization of oscillatory electroencephalographic activity across brain 
      networks, enhancement of sleep-related memory consolidation, image-guided 
      stimulation for connectome control, protocols targeting interneuron pathology and 
      protein clearance, and finally hybrid-brain models for in-silico modeling of AD 
      pathology and personalized target selection. The present work aims to stress the 
      importance of multidisciplinary, translational, model-driven interventions for 
      precision medicine approaches in AD.

AB  - The review provides a comprehensive update (previous report: Chen R, Cros D, 
      Curra A, Di Lazzaro V, Lefaucheur JP, Magistris MR, et al. The clinical 
      diagnostic utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation: report of an IFCN 
      committee. Clin Neurophysiol 2008;119(3):504-32) on clinical diagnostic utility 
      of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in neurological diseases. Most TMS 
      measures rely on stimulation of motor cortex and recording of motor evoked 
      potentials. Paired-pulse TMS techniques, incorporating conventional 
      amplitude-based and threshold tracking, have established clinical utility in 
      neurodegenerative, movement, episodic (epilepsy, migraines), chronic pain and 
      functional diseases. Cortical hyperexcitability has emerged as a diagnostic aid 
      in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Single-pulse TMS measures are of utility in 
      stroke, and myelopathy even in the absence of radiological changes. Short-latency 
      afferent inhibition, related to central cholinergic transmission, is reduced in 
      Alzheimer's disease. The triple stimulation technique (TST) may enhance 
      diagnostic utility of conventional TMS measures to detect upper motor neuron 
      involvement. The recording of motor evoked potentials can be used to perform 
      functional mapping of the motor cortex or in preoperative assessment of eloquent 
      brain regions before surgical resection of brain tumors. TMS exhibits utility in 
      assessing lumbosacral/cervical nerve root function, especially in demyelinating 
      neuropathies, and may be of utility in localizing the site of facial nerve 
      palsies. TMS measures also have high sensitivity in detecting subclinical 
      corticospinal lesions in multiple sclerosis. Abnormalities in central motor 
      conduction time or TST correlate with motor impairment and disability in MS. 
      Cerebellar stimulation may detect lesions in the cerebellum or 
      cerebello-dentato-thalamo-motor cortical pathways. Combining TMS with 
      electroencephalography, provides a novel method to measure parameters altered in 
      neurological disorders, including cortical excitability, effective connectivity, 
      and response complexity.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive brain 
      stimulation technique, has emerged as a promising treatment for mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, however, the 
      effectiveness of this therapy is unclear because of the low statistical power and 
      heterogeneity of previous trials. The purpose of the meta-analysis was to 
      systematically characterize the effectiveness of various combinations of rTMS 
      parameters on different cognitive domains in patients with MCI and AD. Thirteen 
      studies comprising 293 patients with MCI or AD were included in this analysis. 
      Random-effects analysis revealed an overall medium-to-large effect size (0.77) 
      favoring active rTMS over sham rTMS in the improvement of cognitive functions. 
      Subgroup analyses revealed that (1) high-frequency rTMS over the left 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and low-frequency rTMS at the right dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex significantly improved memory functions; (2) high-frequency 
      rTMS targeting the right inferior frontal gyrus significantly enhanced executive 
      performance; and (3) the effects of 5-30 consecutive rTMS sessions could last for 
      4-12 weeks. Potential mechanisms of rTMS effects on cognitive functions are 
      discussed.

      and challenges.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major neurodegenerative diseases and the 
      most common form of dementia. Characterized by the loss of learning, memory, 
      problem-solving, language, and other thinking abilities, AD exerts a detrimental 
      effect on both patients' and families' quality of life. Although there have been 
      significant advances in understanding the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis 
      and progression of AD, there is no cure for AD. The failure of numerous molecular 
      targeted pharmacologic clinical trials leads to an emerging research shift toward 
      non-invasive therapies, especially multiple targeted non-invasive treatments. In 
      this paper, we reviewed the advances of the most widely studied non-invasive 
      therapies, including photobiomodulation (PBM), transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and exercise therapy. 
      Firstly, we reviewed the pathological changes of AD and the challenges for AD 
      studies. We then introduced these non-invasive therapies and discussed the 
      factors that may affect the effects of these therapies. Additionally, we review 
      the effects of these therapies and the possible mechanisms underlying these 
      effects. Finally, we summarized the challenges of the non-invasive treatments in 
      future AD studies and clinical applications. We concluded that it would be 
      critical to understand the exact underlying mechanisms and find the optimal

TI  - Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Treatments for Depression in Parkinson's 
      Disease: An Updated Review.
LID - 10.3390/medicina59081454 [doi]
LID - 1454
AB  - Depression represents one of the most common non-motor disorders in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) and it has been related to worse life quality, higher levels of 
      disability, and cognitive impairment, thereby majorly affecting not only the 
      patients but also their caregivers. Available pharmacological therapeutic options 
      for depression in PD mainly include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 
      serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants; 
      meanwhile, agents acting on dopaminergic pathways used for motor symptoms, such 
      as levodopa, dopaminergic agonists, and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors, 
      may also provide beneficial antidepressant effects. Recently, there is a growing 
      interest in non-pharmacological interventions, including cognitive behavioral 
      therapy; physical exercise, including dance and mind-body exercises, such as 
      yoga, tai chi, and qigong; acupuncture; therapeutic massage; music therapy; 
      active therapy; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS); and 
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for refractory cases. However, the optimal 
      treatment approach for PD depression is uncertain, its management may be 
      challenging, and definite guidelines are also lacking. It is still unclear which 
      of these interventions is the most appropriate and for which PD stage under which 
      circumstances. Herein, we aim to provide an updated comprehensive review of both 
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for depression in PD, focusing 
      on recent clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Finally, we 
      discuss the pharmacological agents that are currently under investigation at a 
      clinical level, as well as future approaches based on the pathophysiological 
      mechanisms underlying the onset of depression in PD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Disabling gait symptoms, especially freezing of gait (FoG), 
      represents a milestone in the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). This 
      systematic review and network meta-analysis assessed and ranked interventions 
      according to their effectiveness in treating gait symptoms in people with PD 
      across four different groups of gait measures. METHODS: A systematic search was 
      carried out across PubMed, EMBASE, PubMed Central (PMC), and Cochrane Central 
      Library from January 2000 to April 2021. All interventions, or combinations, were 
      included. The primary outcome was changes in objective gait measures, before and 
      after intervention. Outcome measures in the included studies were stratified into 
      four different types of gait outcome measures; dynamic gait, fitness, balance, 
      and freezing of gait. For the statistical analysis, five direct head-to-head 
      comparisons of interventions, as well as indirect comparisons were performed. 
      Corresponding forest plots ranking the interventions were generated. RESULTS: The 
      search returned 6288 articles. From these, 148 articles could be included. Of the 
      four different groups of measurement, three were consistent, meaning that there 
      was agreement between direct and indirect evidence. The groups with consistent 
      evidence were dynamic gait, fitness, and freezing of gait. For dynamic gait 
      measures, treatments with the largest observed effect were Aquatic Therapy with 
      dual task exercising (SMD 1.99 [- 1.00; 4.98]) and strength and balance training 
      (SMD 1.95 [- 0.20; 4.11]). For measures of fitness, treatments with the largest 
      observed effects were aquatic therapy (SMD 3.41 [2.11; 4.71] and high-frequency 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (SMD 2.51 [1.48; 3.55]). For FoG 
      measures, none of the included interventions yielded significant results. 
      CONCLUSION: Some interventions can ameliorate gait impairment in people with PD. 
      No recommendations on a superior intervention can be made. None of the studied 
      interventions proved to be efficacious in the treatment of FoG. PROSPERO

TI  - Dementia Is More Than Memory Loss: Neuropsychiatric Symptoms of Dementia and 
      Their Nonpharmacological and Pharmacological Management.
PG  - 528-543
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.20220508 [doi]
AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia (NPS) are a group of noncognitive symptoms 
      that occur in over 90% of individuals with dementia. NPS seem to result from a 
      complex interaction among various biological, psychosocial, and environmental 
      factors, and they are associated with greater morbidity and mortality, higher 
      caregiver burden and burnout, high risk of nursing home placement, and increased 
      cost of care for patients with dementia. Use of standardized assessment tools 
      like the Neuropsychiatric Inventory can assist with qualifying and quantifying 
      NPS. In this review, the authors evaluate the evidence for efficacy and safety of 
      nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions for treating NPS, mostly 
      based on published meta-analyses. Commonly prescribed medications include 
      atypical antipsychotics, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, 
      antidepressants, and mood stabilizers. There are also limited data on 
      cannabinoids, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and ECT in 
      individuals with NPS. Available evidence indicates that several 
      nonpharmacological interventions are beneficial in the management of NPS and are 
      recommended as first-line treatments. Pharmacotherapy should be reserved for the 
      treatment of more severe or refractory NPS or where nonpharmacological management 
      is not feasible. Atypical antipsychotics have shown mostly modest benefit in 
      reducing NPS, and their use is limited by their adverse effect profiles. Recent 
      investigations suggest potential strategies for preventing or at least reducing 
      the risk of dementia and NPS. The authors conclude with brief guidelines for 
      clinical practice as well as future research.

TI  - Oropharyngeal dysphagia in older persons - from pathophysiology to adequate 
      intervention: a review and summary of an international expert meeting.
PG  - 189-208
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S97481 [doi]
AB  - Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a highly prevalent and growing condition in the 
      older population. Although OD may cause very severe complications, it is often 
      not detected, explored, and treated. Older patients are frequently unaware of 
      their swallowing dysfunction which is one of the reasons why the consequences of 
      OD, ie, aspiration, dehydration, and malnutrition, are regularly not attributed 
      to dysphagia. Older patients are particularly vulnerable to dysphagia because 
      multiple age-related changes increase the risk of dysphagia. Physicians in charge 
      of older patients should be aware that malnutrition, dehydration, and pneumonia 
      are frequently caused by (unrecognized) dysphagia. The diagnosis is particularly 
      difficult in the case of silent aspiration. In addition to numerous screening 
      tools, videofluoroscopy was the traditional gold standard of diagnosing OD. 
      Recently, the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing is increasingly 
      utilized because it has several advantages. Besides making a diagnosis, 
      fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing is applied to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of therapeutic maneuvers and texture modification of food and 
      liquids. In addition to swallowing training and nutritional interventions, newer 
      rehabilitation approaches of stimulation techniques are showing promise and may 
      significantly impact future treatment strategies.

TI  - Depression in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: Current Understanding of its 
      Neurobiology and Implications for Treatment.
PG  - 417-439

AB  - Depression is one of the most frequent and burdensome non-motor symptoms in 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), across all stages. Even when its severity is mild, PD 
      depression has a great impact on quality of life for these patients and their 
      caregivers. Accordingly, accurate diagnosis, supported by validated scales, 
      identification of risk factors, and recognition of motor and non-motor symptoms 
      comorbid to depression are critical to understanding the neurobiology of 
      depression, which in turn determines the effectiveness of dopaminergic drugs, 
      antidepressants and non-pharmacological interventions. Recent advances using in 
      vivo functional and structural imaging demonstrate that PD depression is 
      underpinned by dysfunction of limbic networks and monoaminergic systems, 
      depending on the stage of PD and its associated symptoms, including apathy, 
      anxiety, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), cognitive impairment 
      and dementia. In particular, the evolution of serotonergic, noradrenergic, and 
      dopaminergic dysfunction and abnormalities of limbic circuits across time, 
      involving the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices, amygdala, thalamus 
      and ventral striatum, help to delineate the variable expression of depression in 
      patients with prodromal, early and advanced PD. Evidence is accumulating to 
      support the use of dual serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors 
      (desipramine, nortriptyline, venlafaxine) in patients with PD and moderate to 
      severe depression, while selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation and cognitive behavioral therapy may also be 
      considered. In all patients, recent findings advocate that optimization of 
      dopamine replacement therapy and evaluation of deep brain stimulation of the 
      subthalamic nucleus to improve motor symptoms represents an important first step, 
      in addition to physical activity. Overall, this review indicates that increasing 
      understanding of neurobiological changes help to implement a roadmap of tailored 
      interventions for patients with PD and depression, depending on the stage and 
      comorbid symptoms underlying PD subtypes and their prognosis.

AB  - The cerebellum plays a fundamental role in movement execution and motor control 
      in humans. Because of multiple cerebellar connections and a broad variety of 
      motor and nonmotor functions, the field of cerebellar stimulation with 
      noninvasive techniques has gained success among researchers in the last few 
      years. These techniques allow investigation of the neural network noninvasively, 
      collecting more information on cerebellar physiology and pathophysiology. Several 
      studies have highlighted the therapeutic potential of noninvasive brain 
      stimulation (NIBS) - repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and 
      transcranial direct current stimulation of the brain - in patients with 
      neurologic diseases. More recently, NIBS has been delivered over the human 
      cerebellum. Cerebellar NIBS has provided interesting novel data about cerebellar 
      physiology in humans, especially in relation to its cognitive and behavioral 
      functions. Cerebellar NIBS is also increasingly tested in patients with ataxia, 
      dystonia, Parkinson disease, stroke, and essential tremor. NIBS is a promising 
      approach not only to elucidate the numerous cerebellar functions, but also to 
      improve the management of cerebellar ataxias in children and in adults.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Depression is a presenting symptom of common psychiatric 
      disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. 
      Depression can also be the presenting symptom of several neurodegenerative 
      disorders, including Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal 
      dementia, and Parkinson disease. Depression can also cause cognitive impairment 
      and is a risk factor for dementia. As a result of the intimate relationship 
      between depression and dementia, differentiating between a psychiatric and a 
      neurologic cause of depression and dementia can sometimes be very difficult. The 
      purpose of this review is to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of depression 
      and to demonstrate how new diagnostic tools are helping to identify the 
      differential diagnosis of depression. RECENT FINDINGS: It is a time of great 
      advancement in the management of depression. Innovative new medications, 
      psychotherapeutic modalities, and new and investigational somatic treatments (eg, 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation) are making it possible 
      to ameliorate and manage symptoms more effectively in more patients. SUMMARY: 
      With our greater ability to improve the lives of patients with depression, it is 
      important for neurologists to recognize depression and work with our psychiatric 
      colleagues to help patients access the newest and best treatments.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a looming epidemic, growing most rapidly in the 
      elderly population. Some of the most devastating sequelae of TBI are related to 
      depressed levels of consciousness (e.g., coma, minimally conscious state) or 
      deficits in executive function. To date, pharmacological and rehabilitative 
      therapies to treat these sequelae are limited. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has 
      been used to treat a number of pathologies, including Parkinson disease, 
      essential tremor, and epilepsy. Animal and clinical research shows that targets 
      addressing depressed levels of consciousness include components of the ascending 
      reticular activating system and areas of the thalamus. Targets for improving 
      executive function are more varied and include areas that modulate attention and 
      memory, such as the frontal and prefrontal cortex, fornix, nucleus accumbens, 
      internal capsule, thalamus, and some brainstem nuclei. The authors review the 
      literature addressing the use of DBS to treat higher-order cognitive dysfunction 
      and disorders of consciousness in TBI patients, while also offering suggestions 
      on directions for future research.

AB  - Low birth rates and increasing life expectancy experienced by developed societies 
      have placed an unprecedented pressure on governments and the health system to 
      deal effectively with the human, social and financial burden associated to 
      aging-related diseases. At present, ∼24 million people worldwide suffer from 
      cognitive neurodegenerative diseases, a prevalence that doubles every five years. 
      Pharmacological therapies and cognitive training/rehabilitation have generated 
      temporary hope and, occasionally, proof of mild relief. Nonetheless, these 
      approaches are yet to demonstrate a meaningful therapeutic impact and changes in 
      prognosis. We here review evidence gathered for nearly a decade on non-invasive 
      brain stimulation (NIBS), a less known therapeutic strategy aiming to limit 
      cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Transcranial 
      Magnetic Stimulation and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, two of the most 
      popular NIBS technologies, use electrical fields generated non-invasively in the 
      brain to long-lastingly enhance the excitability/activity of key brain regions 
      contributing to relevant cognitive processes. The current comprehensive critical 
      review presents proof-of-concept evidence and meaningful cognitive outcomes of 
      NIBS in eight of the most prevalent neurodegenerative pathologies affecting 
      cognition: Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, 
      Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), behavioral variant of Frontotemporal 
      Dementia, Corticobasal Syndrome, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and Posterior 
      Cortical Atrophy. We analyzed a total of 70 internationally published studies: 33 
      focusing on Alzheimer's disease, 19 on PPA and 18 on the remaining 
      neurodegenerative pathologies. The therapeutic benefit and clinical significance 
      of NIBS remains inconclusive, in particular given the lack of a sufficient number 
      of double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials using multiday 
      stimulation regimes, the heterogeneity of the protocols, and adequate behavioral 
      and neuroimaging response biomarkers, able to show lasting effects and an impact 
      on prognosis. The field remains promising but, to make further progress, research 
      efforts need to take in account the latest evidence of the anatomical and 
      neurophysiological features underlying cognitive deficits in these patient 
      populations. Moreover, as the development of in vivo biomarkers are ongoing, 
      allowing for an early diagnosis of these neuro-cognitive conditions, one could 
      consider a scenario in which NIBS treatment will be personalized and made part of 
      a cognitive rehabilitation program, or useful as a potential adjunct to drug 
      therapies since the earliest stages of suh diseases. Research should also 
      integrate novel knowledge on the mechanisms and constraints guiding the impact of 
      electrical and magnetic fields on cerebral tissues and brain activity, and 
      incorporate the principles of information-based neurostimulation.

TI  - Efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation on global cognition and 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A 
      meta-analysis and systematic review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have shown some 
      promise in improving cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people with 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI). However, data from clinical trials involving NIBS have shown inconsistent 
      results. This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of NIBS, specifically 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS) compared to sham stimulation on global cognition and 
      NPS in people with AD and MCI. METHOD: Multi-session randomized sham-controlled 
      clinical trials were identified through MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase until June 
      2021. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between 
      the active and sham treatments were calculated using random-effects 
      meta-analyses. Included studies reported outcome measures for global cognition 
      and/or NPS. Heterogeneity, from different NIBS techniques, disease populations, 
      or tests used to assess global cognition or NPS, was measured using chi-square 
      and I(2), and investigated using subgroup analyses. Possible effects of 
      covariates were also investigated using meta-regressions. RESULT: The pooled 
      meta-analyses included 19 studies measuring global cognition (N(active)=288, 
      N(sham)=264), and 9 studies investigating NPS (N(active)=165, N(sham)=140). NIBS 
      significantly improved global cognition (SMD=1.14; 95% CI=0.49,1.78; p = 0.001; 
      I(2) = 90.2%) and NPS (SMD=0.82; 95% CI=0.13, 1.50; p = 0.019; I(2) = 86.1%) 
      relative to sham stimulation in patients with AD and MCI. Subgroup analyses found 
      these effects were restricted to rTMS but not tDCS, and to patients with AD but 
      not MCI. Meta-regression showed that age was significantly associated with global 
      cognition response (N(studies)=16, p = 0.020, I(2) = 89.51%, R(2) = 28.96%), with 
      larger effects sizes in younger populations. All significant meta-analyses had 
      large effect sizes (SMD ≥0.8), suggesting clinical utility of NIBS in the short 
      term. There remained substantial heterogeneity across all subgroup analyses and 
      meta-regressions (all I(2) > 50%). Egger's tests showed no evidence of 
      publication biases. CONCLUSION: rTMS improved global cognition and NPS in those 
      with AD. Further studies in MCI and using tDCS will help to fully evaluate the 
      specific NIBS techniques and populations most likely to benefit on global 
      cognition and NPS measures. Additional research should investigate the long term 
      clinical utility of NIBS in these populations.

TI  - The Movement Disorder Society Evidence-Based Medicine Review Update: Treatments 
      for the non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
PG  - S42-80
LID - 10.1002/mds.23884 [doi]
AB  - The Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force on Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) 
      Review of Treatments for Parkinson's Disease (PD) was first published in 2002 and 
      was updated in 2005 to cover clinical trial data up to January 2004 with the 
      focus on motor symptoms of PD. In this revised version the MDS task force decided 
      it was necessary to extend the review to non-motor symptoms. The objective of 
      this work was to update previous EBM reviews on treatments for PD with a focus on 
      non-motor symptoms. Level-I (randomized controlled trial, RCT) reports of 
      pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for the non-motor symptoms 
      of PD, published as full articles in English between January 2002 and December 
      2010 were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion and ranking followed the original 
      program outline and adhered to EBM methodology. For efficacy conclusions, 
      treatments were designated: efficacious, likely efficacious, unlikely 
      efficacious, non-efficacious, or insufficient evidence. Safety data were 
      catalogued and reviewed. Based on the combined efficacy and safety assessment, 
      Implications for clinical practice were determined using the following 
      designations: clinically useful, possibly useful, investigational, unlikely 
      useful, and not useful. Fifty-four new studies qualified for efficacy review 
      while several other studies covered safety issues. Updated and new efficacy 
      conclusions were made for all indications. The treatments that are efficacious 
      for the management of the different non-motor symptoms are as follows: 
      pramipexole for the treatment of depressive symptoms, clozapine for the treatment 
      of psychosis, rivastigmine for the treatment of dementia, and botulinum toxin A 
      (BTX-A) and BTX-B as well as glycopyrrolate for the treatment of sialorrhea. The 
      practical implications for these treatments, except for glycopyrrolate, are that 
      they are clinically useful. Since there is insufficient evidence of 
      glycopyrrolate for the treatment of sialorrhea exceeding 1 week, the practice 
      implication is that it is possibly useful. The treatments that are likely 
      efficacious for the management of the different non-motor symptoms are as 
      follows: the tricyclic antidepressants nortriptyline and desipramine for the 
      treatment of depression or depressive symptoms and macrogol for the treatment of 
      constipation. The practice implications for these treatments are possibly useful. 
      For most of the other interventions there is insufficient evidence to make 
      adequate conclusions on their efficacy. This includes the tricyclic 
      antidepressant amitriptyline, all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) 
      reviewed (paroxetine, citalopram, sertraline, and fluoxetine), the newer 
      antidepressants atomoxetine and nefazodone, pergolide, Ω-3 fatty acids as well as 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of 
      depression or depressive symptoms; methylphenidate and modafinil for the 
      treatment of fatigue; amantadine for the treatment of pathological gambling; 
      donepezil, galantamine, and memantine for the treatment of dementia; quetiapine 
      for the treatment of psychosis; fludrocortisone and domperidone for the treatment 
      of orthostatic hypotension; sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, 
      ipratropium bromide spray for the treatment of sialorrhea; levodopa/carbidopa 
      controlled release (CR), pergolide, eszopiclone, melatonin 3 to 5 mg and 
      melatonin 50 mg for the treatment of insomnia and modafinil for the treatment of 
      excessive daytime sleepiness. Due to safety issues the practice implication is 
      that pergolide and nefazodone are not useful for the above-mentioned indications. 
      Due to safety issues, olanzapine remains not useful for the treatment of 
      psychosis. As none of the studies exceeded a duration of 6 months, the 
      recommendations given are for the short-term management of the different 
      non-motor symptoms. There were no RCTs that met inclusion criteria for the 
      treatment of anxiety disorders, apathy, medication-related impulse control 
      disorders and related behaviors other than pathological gambling, rapid eye 
      movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sweating, or urinary dysfunction. 
      Therefore, there is insufficient evidence for the treatment of these indications. 
      This EBM review of interventions for the non-motor symptoms of PD updates the 
      field, but, because several RCTs are ongoing, a continual updating process is 
      needed. Several interventions and indications still lack good quality evidence, 
      and these gaps offer an opportunity for ongoing research. © 2011 Movement

      impairment (MCI), and to determine whether cognitive training (CT) during rTMS or 
      tDCS provides additional benefits. METHODS: Electronic search of PubMed, Medline, 
      Embase, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO up to 5 March 2020. We enrolled 
      double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcomes were 
      acceptability and pre-post treatment changes in general cognition measured by 
      Mini-Mental State Examination, and the secondary outcomes were memory function, 
      verbal fluency, working memory and executive function. Durability of cognitive 
      benefits (1, 2 and ≥3 months) after brain stimulation was examined. RESULTS: We 
      included 27 RCTs (n=1070), and the treatment components included high-frequency 
      rTMS (HFrTMS) and low-frequency rTMS, anodal tDCS (atDCS) and cathodal tDCS 
      (ctDCS), CT, sham CT and sham brain stimulation. Risk of bias of evidence in each 
      domain was low (range: 0%-11.1%). HFrTMS (1.08, 9, 0.35-1.80) and atDCS (0.56, 
      0.03-1.09) had short-term positive effects on general cognition. CT might be 
      associated with negative effects on general cognition (-0.79, -2.06 to 0.48) 
      during rTMS or tDCS. At 1-month follow-up, HFrTMS (1.65, 0.77-2.54) and ctDCS 
      (2.57, 0.20-4.95) exhibited larger therapeutic responses. Separate analysis of 
      populations with pure AD and MCI revealed positive effects only in individuals 
      with AD. rTMS and tDCS were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: HFrTMS is more effective 
      than atDCS for improving global cognition, and patients with AD may have better 
      responses to rTMS and tDCS than MCI.

AB  - Lateral trunk flexion is often seen in patients with Parkinson disease, sometimes 
      coming on as a subacute phenomenon associated with medication adjustments, and in 
      others with gradual onset that seems related to a neurodegenerative process 
      related to the evolution of the disease.Either acute or subacute presentations 
      seem to be pure abnormalities in the coronal plane and are usually reversible. 
      However, a chronic form occurs often in a combined fashion with anteroposterior 
      flexion (camptocormia), improves only partially, remains stable, or even worsens 
      over time.The acute/subacute phenotype is the condition originally named as Pisa 
      syndrome (PS).The pathophysiology of PS remains poorly understood, and a 
      cholinergic-dopaminergic imbalance has been suggested as being involved in the 
      cause of this disorder. The role of other neurotransmitters and how they become 
      dysfunctional in PS remains to be elucidated.Specific treatments, other than 
      discontinuing the medications responsible for the disorder, whenever possible, 
      are undeveloped because of the unknown etiology.

TI  - Transcranial pulse stimulation in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - e14372
LID - 10.1111/cns.14372 [doi]
LID - e14372
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcranial pulse stimulation (TPS) is a novel noninvasive 
      ultrasonic brain stimulation that can increase cortical and corticospinal 
      excitability, induce neuroplasticity, and increase functional connectivity within 
      the brain. Several trials have confirmed its potential in treating Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect and safety of TPS on AD. 
      DESIGN: A systematic review. METHODS: PubMed, Embase via Ovid, Web of Science, 
      Cochrane Library, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP (China 
      Science and Technology Journal Database), and WanFang were searched from 
      inception to April 1, 2023. Study selection, data extraction, and quality 
      evaluation of the studies were conducted by two reviewers independently, with any 
      controversy resolved by consensus. The Methodological Index for Nonrandomized 
      Studies was used to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS: Five studies were included 
      in this review, with a total of 99 patients with AD. For cognitive performance, 
      TPS significantly improved the scores of the CERAD (Consortium to Establish a 
      Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) test battery, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
      Scale (cognitive), Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Mini-Mental Status 
      Examination. For depressive symptoms, TPS significantly reduced the scores of the 
      Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (affective), Geriatric Depression Score, and 
      Beck Depression Inventory. By functional magnetic resonance imaging, studies have 
      shown that TPS improved cognitive performance in AD patients by increasing 
      functional connectivity in the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, precuneus, 
      and parietal cortex, and activating cortical activity in the bilateral 
      hippocampus. TPS alleviated depressive symptoms in AD patients by decreasing 
      functional connectivity between the ventromedial network (left frontal orbital 
      cortex) and the salience network (right anterior insula). Adverse events in this 
      review, including headache, worsening mood, jaw pain, nausea, and drowsiness, 
      were reversible and lasted no longer than 1 day. No serious adverse events or 
      complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: TPS is promising in improving cognitive 
      performance and reducing depressive symptoms in patients with AD. TPS may be a 
      safe adjunct therapy in the treatment of AD. However, these findings lacked a 
      sham control and were limited by the small sample size of the included studies. 
      Further research may be needed to better explore the potential of TPS. PATIENT 
      AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT: Patients and the public were not involved in this study.

AB  - In advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), the emergence of symptoms refractory to 
      conventional therapy poses therapeutic challenges. The success of deep brain 
      stimulation (DBS) and advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of PD 
      have raised interest in noninvasive brain stimulation as an alternative 
      therapeutic tool. The rationale for its use draws from the concept that reversing 
      abnormalities in brain activity and physiology thought to cause the clinical 
      deficits may restore normal functioning. Currently the best evidence in support 
      of this concept comes from DBS, which improves motor deficits, and modulates 
      brain activity and motor cortex physiology, although whether a causal interaction 
      exists remains largely undetermined. Most trials of noninvasive brain stimulation 
      in PD have applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), targeting 
      the motor cortex. Current studies suggest a possible therapeutic potential for 
      rTMS and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), but clinical effects so 
      far have been small and negligible with regard to functional independence and 
      quality of life. Approaches to potentiate the efficacy of rTMS include increasing 
      stimulation intensity and novel stimulation parameters that derive their 
      rationale from studies on brain physiology. These novel parameters are intended 
      to simulate normal firing patterns or to act on the hypothesized role of 
      oscillatory activity in the motor cortex and basal ganglia with regard to motor 
      control and its contribution to the pathogenesis of motor disorders. Noninvasive 
      brain stimulation studies will enhance our understanding of PD pathophysiology 
      and might provide further evidence for potential therapeutic applications.

AB  - There have been a large number of basic research studies of noninvasive brain 
      stimulation in Parkinson's disease. Initial work focused on measuring: (1) the 
      excitability of corticospinal output with threshold and input-output measures, 
      and (2) the effectiveness of intracortical γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic 
      inhibitory systems using short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), 
      long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), and silent period measures. Early 
      suggestions of increased excitability and reduced inhibition have been 
      progressively modified. There are conflicting reports on changes in excitability, 
      silent period, and LICI, and the more consistent reduction in SICI is now viewed 
      as a superimposed excitation rather than a primary deficit in a GABAergic 
      mechanism. A small number of studies have suggested that premovement increases in 
      corticospinal excitability may be prolonged in Parkinson's disease, consistent 
      with the suggestion of slower buildup of the motor command to move; there are 
      also modifications of interhemispheric connections in patients with mirror 
      movements. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has also been used to explore 
      the involvement of motor cortex and cerebellum in resting and postural tremors by 
      examining how readily they can be reset by single TMS pulses over each area. It 
      can also probe the effects of deep brain stimulation of motor cortex 
      excitability. Finally, new TMS techniques that examine synaptic plasticity in 
      motor cortex have shown reduced excitability in patients off therapy which is 
      restored when on therapy. Data are also emerging about the possible role of 
      cortical plasticity in compensating for gradual loss of dopaminergic function 
      prior to onset of clinical symptoms.

AB  - Brain stimulation techniques can modulate cognitive functions in many 
      neuropsychiatric diseases. Pilot studies have shown promising effects of brain 
      stimulations on Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain stimulations can be categorized 
      into non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and invasive brain stimulation (IBS). 
      IBS includes deep brain stimulation (DBS), and invasive vagus nerve stimulation 
      (VNS), whereas NIBS includes transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), 
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current 
      stimulation (tACS), electroconvulsive treatment (ECT), magnetic seizure therapy 
      (MST), cranial electrostimulation (CES), and non-invasive VNS. We reviewed the 
      cutting-edge research on these brain stimulation techniques and discussed their 
      therapeutic effects on AD. Both IBS and NIBS may have potential to be developed 
      as novel treatments for AD; however, mixed findings may result from different 
      study designs, patients selection, population, or samples sizes. Therefore, the 
      efficacy of NIBS and IBS in AD remains uncertain, and needs to be further 
      investigated. Moreover, more standardized study designs with larger sample sizes 
      and longitudinal follow-up are warranted for establishing a structural guide for 
      future studies and clinical application.

AB  - Depression and anxiety are some of the most common comorbidities arising in 
      patients with Parkinson's disease. However, their timely recognition and 
      diagnosis are often hindered by overlap with other somatic features and a low 
      rate of self-report. There is a need for greater awareness and for better 
      assessment and treatment options are highly required. Currently available scales 
      can serve as tools to monitor change over time and the effect of interventional 
      strategies. Development of new therapeutic strategies, including 
      nonpharmacological approaches such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep 
      brain stimulation, may provide alternatives to currently available treatment 
      approaches. In this chapter we will give an overview of the most recent advances 
      in the diagnosis and treatment of these important nonmotor symptoms.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is among a growing family of noninvasive 
      brain stimulation techniques being developed to treat multiple neurocognitive 
      disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although small clinical trials in 
      AD have reported positive effects on cognitive outcome measures, significant 
      knowledge gaps remain, and little attention has been directed at examining the 
      potential influence of TMS on AD pathogenesis. Our review briefly outlines some 
      of the proposed neurobiological mechanisms of TMS benefits in AD, with particular 
      emphasis on the modulatory effects on excitatory/inhibitory balance. On the basis 
      of converging evidence from multiple fields, we caution that TMS therapeutic 
      protocols established in young adults may have unexpected detrimental effects in 
      older individuals or in the brain compromised by AD pathology. Our review surveys 
      clinical studies of TMS in AD alongside basic research as a guide for moving this 
      important area of work forward toward effective treatment development.

AB  - Neuromodulation is a widely used treatment for motor symptoms of Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). It can be a highly effective treatment as a result of knowledge of 
      circuit dysfunction associated with motor symptoms in PD. However, the mechanisms 
      underlying cognitive symptoms of PD are less well-known, and the effects of 
      neuromodulation on these symptoms are less consistent. Nonetheless, 
      neuromodulation provides a unique opportunity to modulate motor and cognitive 
      circuits while minimizing off-target side effects. We review the modalities of 
      neuromodulation used in PD and the potential implications for cognitive symptoms. 
      There have been some encouraging findings with both invasive and noninvasive 
      modalities of neuromodulation, and there are promising advances being made in the 
      field of therapeutic neuromodulation. Substantial work is needed to determine 
      which modulation targets are most effective for the different types of cognitive 
      deficits of PD.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful tool to probe in vivo brain 
      circuits, as it allows to assess several cortical properties such asexcitability, 
      plasticity and connectivity in humans. In the last 20 years, TMS has been applied 
      to patients with dementia, enabling the identification of potential markers of 
      thepathophysiology and predictors of cognitive decline; moreover, applied 
      repetitively, TMS holds promise as a potential therapeutic intervention. The 
      objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of studies that have 
      employed TMS in dementia and to discuss potential clinical applications, from the 
      diagnosis to the treatment. To provide a technical and theoretical framework, we 
      first present an overview of the basic physiological mechanisms of the 
      application of TMS to assess cortical excitability, excitation and inhibition 
      balance, mechanisms of plasticity and cortico-cortical connectivity in the human 
      brain. We then review the insights gained by TMS techniques into the 
      pathophysiology and predictors of progression and response to treatment in 
      dementias, including Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related dementias and secondary 
      dementias. We show that while a single TMS measure offers low specificity, the 
      use of a panel of measures and/or neurophysiological index can support the 
      clinical diagnosis and predict progression. In the last part of the article, we 
      discuss the therapeutic uses of TMS. So far, only repetitive TMS (rTMS) over the 
      left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and multisite rTMS associated with cognitive 
      training have been shown to be, respectively, possibly (Level C of evidence) and 
      probably (Level B of evidence) effective to improve cognition, apathy, memory, 
      and language in AD patients, especially at a mild/early stage of the disease. The 
      clinical use of this type of treatment warrants the combination of brain imaging 
      techniques and/or electrophysiological tools to elucidate neurobiological effects 
      of neurostimulation and to optimally tailor rTMS treatment protocols in 
      individual patients or specific patient subgroups with dementia or mild cognitive 
      impairment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lewy body disease (LBD) is the second most common neurodegenerative 
      disorder in patients older than 65 years. LBD is characterized by heterogeneous 
      symptoms like fluctuation in attention, visual hallucinations, Parkinsonism, and 
      REM sleep behaviour disorders. Considering the relevant social impact of the 
      disease, identifying effective non-pharmacological treatments is becoming a 
      priority. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an up-to-date 
      literature review of the most effective non-pharmacological treatments in 
      patients with LBD, focussing on evidence-based interventions. METHODS: Following 
      PRISMA criteria, we carried out a systematic search through three databases 
      (PubMed, Cochrane Libraries, and PEDro) including physical therapy (PT), 
      cognitive rehabilitation (CR), light therapy (LT), transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroconvulsive 
      therapy (ECT), deep brain stimulation (DBS). All studies were qualitatively 
      assessed using standardized tools (CARE and EPHPP). RESULTS: We obtained a total 
      of 1,220 studies of which 23 original articles met eligibility criteria for 
      inclusion. The total number of LBD patients included was 231; mean age was 69.98, 
      predominantly men (68%). Some PT studies highlighted improvements in motor 
      deficits. CR produced significant improvements in mood, cognition, and patient's 
      quality of life and satisfaction. LT outlined a partial trend of improvements in 
      mood and sleep quality. DBS, ECT, and TMS showed some partial improvements mainly 
      on neuropsychiatric symptoms, whereas tDCS provided partial improvements in 
      attention. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the efficacy of some evidence-based 
      rehabilitation studies in LBD; however, further randomized controlled trials with 
      larger samples are needed to provide definitive recommendations.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive technique that has 
      provided important information about cortical function across an array of 
      neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal 
      dementia, Parkinson's disease, and related extrapyramidal disorders. Application 
      of TMS techniques in neurodegenerative diseases has provided important 
      pathophysiological insights, leading to the development of pathogenic and 
      diagnostic biomarkers that could be used in the clinical setting and therapeutic 
      trials. Abnormalities of TMS outcome measures heralding cortical 
      hyperexcitability, as evidenced by a reduction of short-interval intracortical 
      inhibition and increased in motor-evoked potential amplitude, have been 
      consistently identified as early and intrinsic features of amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS), preceding and correlating with the ensuing neurodegeneration. 
      Cortical hyperexcitability appears to form the pathogenic basis of ALS, mediated 
      by trans-synaptic glutamate-mediated excitotoxic mechanisms. As a consequence of 
      these research findings, TMS has been developed as a potential diagnostic 
      biomarker, capable of identifying upper motor neuronal pathology, at earlier 
      stages of the disease process, and thereby aiding in ALS diagnosis. Of further 
      relevance, marked TMS abnormalities have been reported in other neurodegenerative 
      diseases, which have varied from findings in ALS. With time and greater 
      utilization by clinicians, TMS outcome measures may prove to be of utility in 
      future therapeutic trial settings across the neurodegenerative disease spectrum, 
      including the monitoring of neuroprotective, stem-cell, and genetic-based 
      strategies, thereby enabling assessment of biological effectiveness at early 
      stages of drug development.

AB  - In the human brain, physiological aging is characterized by progressive neuronal 
      loss, leading to disruption of synapses and to a degree of failure in 
      neurotransmission and information flow. However, there is increasing evidence to 
      support the notion that the aged brain has a remarkable level of resilience (i.s. 
      ability to reorganize itself), with the aim of preserving its physiological 
      activity. It is therefore of paramount interest to develop objective markers able 
      to characterize the biological processes underlying brain aging in the intact 
      human, and to distinguish them from brain degeneration associated to age-related 
      neurological progressive diseases like Alzheimer's disease. EEG, alone and 
      combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS-EEG), is particularly suited 
      to this aim, due to the functional nature of the information provided, and thanks 
      to the ease with which it can be integrated in ecological scenarios including 
      behavioral tasks. In this review, we aimed to provide the reader with updated 
      information about the role of modern methods of EEG and TMS-EEG analysis in the 
      investigation of physiological brain aging and Alzheimer's disease. In 
      particular, we focused on data about cortical connectivity obtained by using 
      readouts such graph theory network brain organization and architecture, and 
      transcranial evoked potentials (TEPs) during TMS-EEG. Overall, findings in the 
      literature support an important potential contribution of such neurophysiological 
      techniques to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying normal brain aging 
      and the early (prodromal/pre-symptomatic) stages of dementia.

TI  - Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on gait disorders and 
      cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review with 
      meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is acknowledged 
      to be crucial to manage freezing of gait (FOG) and cognitive impairment for 
      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but its effectiveness is unclear. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of rTMS on FOG and cognitive function in 
      people with PD and to investigate potential factors that modulate the rTMS 
      effects. METHODS: Databases searched included PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and 
      the Cochrane Library from inception to December 31, 2021. Eligible studies 
      include a controlled randomized clinical trial of rTMS intervention for FOG and 
      cognitive dysfunction in PD patients. The weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with fixed-effects models. The outcome 
      of the study included gait and cognitive assessments. RESULTS: Sixteen studies 
      with a total of 419 patients were included. Fixed-effects analysis revealed that 
      rTMS was effective in improving freezing of gait questionnaire scores (short-term 
      effect: WMD = -0.925, 95% CI: -1.642 to -0.209, p = .011; long-term effect: 
      WMD = -2.120, 95% CI: -2.751 to -1.489, p = .000), 10-m walking time (short-term 
      effect: WMD = -0.456, 95% CI: -0.793 to -0.119, p = .008; long-term effect: 
      WMD = -0.526, 95% CI: -0.885 to -0.167, p = .004), Timed Up-and-Go scores 
      (short-term effect: WMD = -1.064, 95% CI: -1.555 to -0.572, p = .000; long-term 
      effect: WMD = -1.097, 95% CI: -1.422 to -0.772, p = .000), Montreal cognitive 
      assessment (WMD = 3.714, 95% CI: 2.567 to 4.861, p = .000), and frontal 
      assessment battery (WMD = -0.584, 95% CI: -0.934 to -0.234, p = .001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: RTMS showed a beneficial effect on FOG and cognitive dysfunction in 
      parkinsonism. However, the optimal rTMS protocol has not been determined and 
      further high-quality studies are needed.

AB  - As the field of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) expands, there is a growing 
      need for comprehensive guidelines on training practitioners in the safe and 
      effective administration of NIBS techniques in their various research and 
      clinical applications. This article provides recommendations on the structure and 
      content of this training. Three different types of practitioners are considered 
      (Technicians, Clinicians, and Scientists), to attempt to cover the range of 
      education and responsibilities of practitioners in NIBS from the laboratory to 
      the clinic. Basic or core competencies and more advanced knowledge and skills are 
      discussed, and recommendations offered regarding didactic and practical 
      curricular components. We encourage individual licensing and governing bodies to 
      implement these guidelines.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be superior to drug therapy in 
      the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and Bayesian network 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 2912-2924
LID - 10.1111/cns.14228 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive 
      brain stimulation therapy that is primarily used to treat a variety of 
      neuropsychiatric conditions. Recently, previous research reports stated that rTMS 
      have the characteristics of neurorestorative in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      However, the relevant clinical research evidence has not been fully summarized. 
      METHODS: This article performed a network meta-analysis of individual participant 
      data from eligible studies searched in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library 
      from inception to March 31, 2022. The drug treatments involved were 
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), 
      anti-amyloid-beta (Aβ), and some new targeted therapeutic drugs. RESULTS: A total 
      of 15, 548 individuals with AD disease in 57 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) 
      were included in this meta-analysis. The results indicated that the patients who 
      received rTMS treatment (standard mean difference [SMD]: 0.65; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI]: 0.22-1.07) had a better MMSE score than placebo. Treatment outcome 
      analysis showed that, compared with multiple pharmacological interventions, rTMS 
      acquired the greatest probability rank with the best cognitive improvement in 
      MMSE score [the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) 93.3%] and 
      ADAS-cog score (SUCRA 86.7%). At the same time, rTMS treatment had the lowest 
      rank in the adverse events (SUCRA 24.1%) except for the placebo group (SUCRA 
      19.1%). CONCLUSION: Compared with the current clinical drug treatment, rTMS 
      demonstrated better cognitive function improvement and fewer adverse events in AD 
      patients. Therefore, rTMS shows broad prospects in the treatment of Alzheimer's 
      disease, and it is worth being widely popularized in clinic.

PG  - 229-36
AB  - The prevalence of major and minor depression in Parkinson's disease is around 
      30-40% but, unfortunately, depression remains frequently underrecognized and 
      often undertreated. However, recognition and appropriate treatment of depression 
      in patients with Parkinson's disease is essential for improving the 
      cross-sectional picture and longitudinal course. This review focuses on the 
      epidemiology, pathophysiology and different treatment modalities of depression in 
      Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in the Treatment of Alzheimer's 
      Disease and Other Dementias.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare9080949 [doi]
LID - 949
AB  - Dementia is a debilitating impairment of cognitive functions that affects 
      millions of people worldwide. There are several diseases belonging to the 
      dementia spectrum, most prominently Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia 
      (VD), Lewy body dementia (LBD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, non-invasive form of brain 
      stimulation that utilizes a magnetic coil to generate an electrical field and 
      induce numerous changes in the brain. It is considered efficacious for the 
      treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders. In this paper, we review the 
      available studies involving rTMS in the treatment of these dementia types. The 
      majority of studies have involved AD and shown beneficial effects, either as a 
      standalone, or as an add-on to standard-of-care pharmacological treatment and 
      cognitive training. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seems to hold a central 
      position in the applied protocols, but several parameters still need to be 
      defined. In addition, rTMS has shown potential in mild cognitive impairment as 
      well. Regarding the remaining dementias, research is still at preliminary phases, 
      and large, randomized studies are currently lacking.

AB  - Dysphagia is a very frequent and highly relevant symptom in Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) for quality of life, morbidity, and remaining lifetime, which is 
      unfortunately widely underdiagnosed and underestimated regarding patients' 
      centered care. Especially in early stages, the causal association between disease 
      and swallowing disabilities remains unnoticed, which may be accounted for by the 
      inability of caregivers and physicians to detect subtle swallowing problems and 
      by the low self-awareness among PD patients. In order to prevent patients from 
      serious negative consequences for health issues (e.g., aspiration pneumonia or 
      malnutrition) as well as for negative impact on their quality of life, it is on 
      the highest importance of managing dysphagia timely and working closely together 
      in a multidisciplinary team, who all are involved in the patients' care system. 
      This chapter includes background information on epidemiology, pathophysiology, 
      and symptomatology of swallowing disorders in PD. This is followed by a summary 
      of the clinical course and health treats, adequate diagnostic procedures for 
      early identification of dysphagia as well as effective treatment strategies. The 
      conclusion provides recommendations for clinical practice routine.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive 
      intervention that holds promise for improving cognitive function in individuals 
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effectiveness of this therapy and the 
      optimal TMS parameters has not reached a consensus. The purpose of the 
      meta-analysis was to systematically discern the effectiveness of different 
      components of TMS protocols on cognitive improvement in patients with mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. METHODS: The meta-analysis was preregistered 
      on Prospero (registration number: CRD42022345482). PubMed, Web of Science, 
      Science Direct, and Cochrane Library databases were used to search, screen and 
      identify eligible studies with the following keywords: Transcranial Magnetic 
      Stimulation OR TMS OR theta burst stimulation AND Alzheimer OR Alzheimers OR 
      Alzheimer's OR mild cognitive impairment OR MCI. Randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) of participants with accepted standardized diagnostic criteria were 
      searched by two authors independently. The risk of bias was assessed using an 
      adapted Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the random-effects models. 
      Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the influential factors. RESULTS: 
      A total of 21 studies and 25 trials were included in this meta-analysis. The 
      findings revealed a significant overall cognition improvement of real stimulation 
      compared with sham stimulation (short-term effects: SMD, 0.91; 95% CI 0.44-1.38; 
      P < 0.01; long-lasting effects: SMD, 0.91; 95% CI 0.27-1.55; P < 0.01). Subgroup 
      analysis demonstrated that stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      and bilateral cerebellums, as well as moderate frequency stimulation (5 Hz and 10 
      Hz) on mild and moderate cognitive impairment patients, were more effective than 
      other TMS protocols. However, the additional application of cognitive training 
      showed no significant improvement. CONCLUSION: Cognitive improvement effect of 
      TMS was demonstrated in MCI and AD patients in both short-term assessment and 
      long-lasting outcomes, and the efficiency of TMS is affected by the stimulation 
      frequency, stimulation site, and participant characteristics. Further RCTs are 
      needed to validate the findings of our subgroup analysis. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a looming public health crisis that currently lacks 
      an effective treatment. Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NBS), particularly 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS), offers a promising alternative approach to pharmacological 
      interventions for an increasing number of neurological and psychiatric 
      conditions. The aim of this review is summarize data from therapeutic trials of 
      NBS in AD and other dementing illnesses. Despite the potential of NBS, there is 
      limited theoretical framework and a lack of guidelines for its applications to 
      AD. Several published clinical trials failed to report key parameters of the 
      interventions thus limiting the utility of the study to assess efficacy and 
      safety. Our review concludes with some suggestions for future studies aimed to 
      advance research into NBS as a potential treatment for the symptoms and 
      disabilities caused by AD and to enable comparison of results across trials. 
      Ultimately, appropriately powered, and controlled, multi-site randomized clinical 
      trials will be needed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of NBS in AD.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neurophysiological tool 
      that enables the investigation of cortical excitability in the human brain. 
      Paired-pulse TMS paradigms include short- and long-interval intracortical 
      inhibition (SICI/LICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-latency 
      afferent inhibition (SAI), which can assess neurophysiological functions of 
      GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic neural circuits, respectively. We 
      conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to compare these TMS 
      indices among patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy 
      controls (HC). Our meta-analyses indicated that RMT, SAI, SICI, and LICI were 
      significantly lower in patients with AD, while ICF did not show a difference in 
      patients with AD compared with HC. In patients with MCI, RMT and SAI were 
      significantly lower than in HC. In conclusion, motor cortical excitability was 
      increased, while cholinergic function was decreased in AD and MCI in comparison 
      with HC and patients with AD had decreased GABAergic and glutamatergic functions 
      compared with HC. Our results warrant further studies to differentiate AD, MCI, 
      and HC, employing multimodal TMS neurophysiology.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method that can be used 
      as an interventional technique to investigate causality in the brain-behavior 
      relationship, through depolarization or hyperpolarization in the neurons of the 
      brain. Different techniques of TMS can be used to investigate causality in the 
      brain-behavior relationship. The behavioral effects induced by TMS are complex 
      since it has been shown that the performance in the same cognitive task can be 
      either facilitated or inhibited depending on the area being stimulated. To date, 
      most studies involving TMS are focused mainly on the facilitation properties of 
      this technique. It is used to treat a wide-range of neurological and psychiatric 
      conditions such as depression, ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, or motor 
      impairment. Interestingly, TMS can be used to induce a virtual lesion that could 
      provide a valuable and much needed model of cognitive impairments in early 
      preclinical development. This review describes the existing TMS paradigms in 
      rodents and the major challenges that were encountered by the researchers as the 
      method was translated from clinical to preclinical applications. In summary, the 
      existing knowledge gained in animal research emphasizes the necessity to 
      investigate new TMS paradigms in the preclinical setting and its effects.

AB  - Surgical neuromodulation has emerged as the primary method to treat the medically 
      refractory symptoms of essential tremor and Parkinson disease. With reversible 
      manipulation of CNS neurons, neuromodulation can be used to intraoperatively 
      localize and verify a stereotactic target, and to chronically treat movement 
      disorders. This article discusses the historical advances in stereotactic surgery 
      using various modalities of neuromodulation leading to contemporary treatment. 
      Electrical neuromodulation, or deep brain stimulation, is emphasized as the major 
      surgical intervention with a discussion of the technique, surgical targets, and 
      clinical outcomes. A comparison of neuromodulation techniques is presented.

LID - 10.1080/13854046.2018.1562093 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To review the research literature pertaining to post-stroke language 
      recovery, and to discuss neurocognitive assessment in patients in the context of 
      aphasia, time course of language recovery, factors associated with language 
      recovery, and therapeutic techniques designed to facilitate language recovery. 
      Method: Articles were identified through PubMed, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Google 
      Scholar searches. Examples of utilized keywords include "post-stroke aphasia," 
      "post-stroke language recovery," "post-stroke neurocognitive assessment," and 
      "neuropsychology and aphasia." Results: Most language recovery occurs in the 
      first few weeks following stroke, but residual recovery may occur for many years. 
      Although initial aphasia severity is the single largest determinant of 
      post-stroke language recovery, a number of other variables also contribute. 
      Several techniques have been developed to aid in the recovery process including 
      speech-language therapy and noninvasive brain stimulation, although the 
      effectiveness of acute and subacute treatment remains unclear. Some degree of 
      valid neurocognitive assessment is possible in patients with aphasia, and the 
      information gained from such an evaluation can aid the rehabilitative process 
      Conclusions: Significant recovery of language function is possible following a 
      stroke, but prediction of level of recovery in an individual patient is 
      difficult. Information about initial aphasia severity and the integrity of 
      cognitive domains other than language can help guide the rehabilitation team, as 
      well as manage expectations for recovery.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      without effective pharmacological treatment. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) 
      techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and 
      transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), are increasingly being investigated 
      for their potential to ameliorate the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and related 
      dementias (ADRD). RECENT FINDINGS: A comprehensive literature review for primary 
      research reports that investigated the ability of TMS/tES to improve cognition in 
      ADRD patients yielded a total of 20 reports since 2016. Eight studies used 
      repetitive TMS and 12 used transcranial direct current stimulation, the most 
      common form of tES. Eight of the studies combined NIBS with cognitive training. 
      Promising results should encourage continued investigation, however there is 
      currently insufficient evidence to support widespread adoption of NIBS-based 
      clinical treatments for ADRD. SUMMARY: NIBS remains an active area of 
      investigation for treatment of ADRD, though the predominance of small, 
      heterogeneous, proof-of-principle studies precludes definitive conclusions. We 
      propose the establishment of a consortium to achieve the benefits of large-scale, 
      controlled studies using biomarker-based diagnostic characterization of 
      participants, development of neurophysiological markers to verify target 
      engagement, and standardization of parameters.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used for therapeutic and 
      research purposes such as cognitive studies, treatment of psychiatric disorders, 
      and Parkinson's disease. In research, TMS is perhaps the only technique that can 
      establish a functional connection between brain regions and task performance. In 
      gait research, often TMS is used to identify the extent to which leg motor cortex 
      is involved in different phases on gait cycle. However, using TMS in gait can be 
      challenging for several technical reasons and physiological variations. The 
      objective of this narrative review is to summarize literature in the field of TMS 
      and gait research and present comprehensive challenges. A comprehensive 
      literature search was conducted in PubMed and Google Scholar to identify all 
      relevant literature on TMS and gait. Several critical challenges could 
      potentially impact the findings. For instance, the use of different protocols to 
      obtain motor threshold. This review presents some of the critical challenges in 
      applying TMS during gait. It is important to be aware of these variations and 
      utilize strategies to mitigate some challenges.

AB  - Brain stimulation techniques offer powerful means of modulating the physiology of 
      specific neural structures. In recent years, non-invasive brain stimulation 
      techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial 
      direct current stimulation, have emerged as therapeutic tools for neurology and 
      neuroscience. However, the possible repercussions of these techniques remain 
      unclear, and there are few reports on the incisive recovery mechanisms through 
      brain stimulation. Although several studies have recommended the use of 
      non-invasive brain stimulation in clinical neuroscience, with a special emphasis 
      on TMS, the suggested mechanisms of action have not been confirmed directly at 
      the neural level. Insights into the neural mechanisms of non-invasive brain 
      stimulation would unveil the strategies necessary to enhance the safety and 
      efficacy of this progressive approach. Therefore, animal studies investigating 
      the mechanisms of TMS-induced recovery at the neural level are crucial for the 
      elaboration of non-invasive brain stimulation. Translational research done using 
      animal models has several advantages and is able to investigate knowledge gaps by 
      directly targeting neuronal levels. In this review, we have discussed the role of 
      TMS in different animal models, the impact of animal studies on various disease 
      states, and the findings regarding brain function of animal models after TMS in 
      pharmacology research.

AB  - Although primary degenerative diseases are the main cause of dementia, a 
      non-negligible proportion of patients is affected by a secondary and potentially 
      treatable cognitive disorder. Therefore, diagnostic tools able to early identify 
      and monitor them and to predict the response to treatment are needed. 
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neurophysiological 
      technique capable of evaluating in vivo and in "real time" the motor areas, the 
      cortico-spinal tract, and the neurotransmission pathways in several neurological 
      and neuropsychiatric disorders, including cognitive impairment and dementia. 
      While consistent evidence has been accumulated for Alzheimer's disease, other 
      degenerative cognitive disorders, and vascular dementia, to date a comprehensive 
      review of TMS studies available in other secondary dementias is lacking. These 
      conditions include, among others, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, multiple 
      sclerosis, celiac disease and other immunologically mediated diseases, as well as 
      a number of inflammatory, infective, metabolic, toxic, nutritional, endocrine, 
      sleep-related, and rare genetic disorders. Overall, we observed that, while in 
      degenerative dementia neurophysiological alterations might mirror specific, and 
      possibly primary, neuropathological changes (and hence be used as early 
      biomarkers), this pathogenic link appears to be weaker for most secondary forms 
      of dementia, in which neurotransmitter dysfunction is more likely related to a 
      systemic or diffuse neural damage. In these cases, therefore, an effort toward 
      the understanding of pathological mechanisms of cognitive impairment should be 
      made, also by investigating the relationship between functional alterations of 
      brain circuits and the specific mechanisms of neuronal damage triggered by the 
      causative disease. Neurophysiologically, although no distinctive TMS pattern can 
      be identified that might be used to predict the occurrence or progression of 
      cognitive decline in a specific condition, some TMS-associated measures of 
      cortical function and plasticity (such as the short-latency afferent inhibition, 
      the short-interval intracortical inhibition, and the cortical silent period) 
      might add useful information in most of secondary dementia, especially in 
      combination with suggestive clinical features and other diagnostic tests. The 
      possibility to detect dysfunctional cortical circuits, to monitor the disease 
      course, to probe the response to treatment, and to design novel neuromodulatory 
      interventions in secondary dementia still represents a gap in the literature that 
      needs to be explored.

AB  - The number of patients with dementia grows rapidly as the global population ages, 
      which posits tremendous health-care burden to the society. Only cholinesterase 
      inhibitors and a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist have been approved for 
      treating patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and their clinical effects 
      remained limited. Medical devices serve as an alternative therapeutic approach to 
      modulating neural activities and enhancing cognitive function. Four major brain 
      stimulation technologies including deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and 
      transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) have been applied to AD in a clinical 
      trial setting. DBS allows electrical stimulation at the specified nucleus but 
      remains resource-demanding, and after all, an invasive surgery; whereas TMS and 
      tDCS are widely available and affordable but less ideal with respect to 
      localization. The unique physical property of TUS, on the other hand, allows both 
      thermal and mechanical energy to be transduced and focused for neuromodulation. 
      In the context of dementia, using focused ultrasound to induce blood-brain 
      barrier opening for delivering drugs and metabolizing amyloid protein has drawn 
      great attention in recent years. Furthermore, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound has 
      demonstrated its neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies, 
      leading to ongoing clinical trials for AD. The potential and limitation of 
      transcranial brain stimulation for treating patients with dementia would be 
      discussed in this review.

AB  - Levodopa has long been the standard of care for Parkinson disease (PD); however, 
      the eventual onset of motor fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) 
      complicates its utility in advanced PD. Current neurosurgical interventions 
      remain some of the best options for LID. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is 
      currently the procedure of choice for patients with advanced PD, patients 
      refractory to medical management, and patients with motor complications from 
      levodopa therapy. Significant progress has been achieved in recent years, 
      however, as newer techniques are making their way through preclinical and 
      clinical studies. Use of interventional magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) and a 
      skull-mounted aiming device to guide electrode placement has improved accuracy in 
      recent DBS studies. Adaptive "closed-loop" DBS represents another exciting 
      advancement in the field, in which real-time feedback allows dynamic modulation 
      of the stimulation delivered to the basal ganglia. Magnetic resonance-guided 
      focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a novel approach to creating precise lesioning in 
      the brain that has shown promising results in preliminary studies for various 
      movement disorders, including dyskinesias, and may transform the neuroablation 
      field. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, which can induce local and distant 
      effects in cortical and subcortical areas, has shown efficacy in managing certain 
      PD and LID symptoms in early studies. Finally, direct stimulation of the motor 
      cortex and the cerebellum has shown therapeutic effects in PD and LID patients in 
      certain studies. Taken together, many of these new techniques have shown great 
      promise in early studies and may eventually be preferred treatment options for 
      LID patients.

AB  - The goal of this review is to show how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
      techniques can make a contribution to the study of brain networks. Brain networks 
      are fundamental in understanding how the brain operates. Effects on remote areas 
      can be directly observed or identified after a period of stimulation, and each 
      section of this review will discuss one method. EEG analyzed following TMS is 
      called TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). A conditioning TMS can influence the effect 
      of a test TMS given over the motor cortex. A disynaptic connection can be tested 
      also by assessing the effect of a pre-conditioning stimulus on the 
      conditioning-test pair. Basal ganglia-cortical relationships can be assessed 
      using electrodes placed in the process of deep brain stimulation therapy. 
      Cerebellar-cortical relationships can be determined using TMS over the 
      cerebellum. Remote effects of TMS on the brain can be found as well using 
      neuroimaging, including both positron emission tomography (PET) and functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The methods complement each other since they 
      give different views of brain networks, and it is often valuable to use more than 
      one technique to achieve converging evidence. The final product of this type of 
      work is to show how information is processed and transmitted in the brain.

AB  - Transcranial noninvasive brain stimulation includes both repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). 
      TMS uses a rapidly changing magnetic field to induce currents and action 
      potentials in underlying brain tissue, whereas tDCS involves the application of 
      weak electrical currents to modulate neuronal membrane potential. In this 
      chapter, we provide a literature review with a focus on the therapeutic potential 
      of both techniques in the treatment of nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease 
      (PD). On the whole, the results of studies are rather preliminary but promising 
      as they show some positive effects of rTMS and tDCS particularly on depressive 
      symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions in PD. More carefully controlled trials with 
      standardized methodology, adequately sized and well-characterized samples, and 
      the inclusion of multimodal approaches are warranted in the future.

TI  - Synaptic Effects of Palmitoylethanolamide in Neurodegenerative Disorders.
LID - 10.3390/biom12081161 [doi]
LID - 1161
AB  - Increasing evidence strongly supports the key role of neuroinflammation in the 
      pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, 
      frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuroinflammation may 
      alter synaptic transmission contributing to the progression of neurodegeneration, 
      as largely documented in animal models and in patients' studies. In the last few 
      years, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous lipid mediator, and its new 
      composite, which is a formulation constituted of PEA and the well-recognized 
      antioxidant flavonoid luteolin (Lut) subjected to an ultra-micronization process 
      (co-ultraPEALut), has been identified as a potential therapeutic agent in 
      different disorders by exerting potential beneficial effects on neurodegeneration 
      and neuroinflammation by modulating synaptic transmission. In this review, we 
      will show the potential therapeutic effects of PEA in animal models and in 
      patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most devastating conditions affecting 
      elderly in Western World. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments, and 
      patients diagnosed with AD face an uncertain future, caused by the current 
      inability to predict the course of the disease. This is mainly due to the poor 
      comprehension of AD pathophysiology and of patients' clinical heterogeneity. In 
      recent years, several evidences supported the concept that loss of synaptic 
      density could be an early event and precede neuronal degeneration, suggesting 
      that the impairment of synaptic transmission should play a key role in the 
      pathogenesis of different forms of dementia, including AD, frontotemporal 
      dementia and Lewy body dementia. Despite this emerging background it has not been 
      possible to quantify synaptic functioning (or dysfunction) directly in vivo in AD 
      patients. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been recently introduced as 
      a novel approach able to identify the early signatures of synaptic dysfunction 
      characterizing the different forms of AD. We review the novel emerging 
      neurophysiological signatures of AD and how this information may be used as 
      biomarkers for differential diagnosis, disease progression and response to 
      therapy. Finally, we also consider novel therapeutic approaches based on the 
      clinical use of repetitive TMS.

TI  - New modalities and directions for dystonia care.
PG  - 559-565
LID - 10.1007/s00702-020-02278-9 [doi]
AB  - Dystonia is an abnormal involuntary movement or posture owing to sustained or 
      intermittent muscle contraction. Standard treatment for dystonia includes 
      medications, such as levodopa, anticholinergic and antiepileptic drugs, botulinum 
      toxin, and baclofen pump, and surgeries, such as lesioning surgery and deep-brain 
      stimulation. New treatment modalities aimed toward improving dystonia care in the 
      future are under investigation. There are two main axes to improve dystonia care; 
      one is non-invasive neuromodulation, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, 
      transcranial electrical stimulation, and transcutaneous electrical nerve 
      stimulation. The other is a quantitative evaluation of dystonia using a wearable 
      device and motion-capturing system, which can be empowered by artificial 
      intelligence. In this article, the current status of these axes will be reviewed.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on the Precuneus in Alzheimer's Disease: 
      A Literature Review.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci13091332 [doi]
LID - 1332
AB  - The current literature review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of rTMS on the 
      precuneus as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the 
      number of studies specifically targeting the precuneus is limited, the results 
      from this review suggest the potential benefits of this approach. Future studies 
      should focus on exploring the long-term effects of rTMS on the precuneus in 
      Alzheimer's disease patients, as well as determining the optimal stimulation 
      parameters and protocols for this population. Additionally, investigating the 
      effects of rTMS on the precuneus in combination with other brain regions 
      implicated in AD may provide valuable insights into the development of effective 
      treatment for this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.

      A narrative review.

AB  - Noninvasive brain stimulation/modulation is a rapidly emerging technique that has 
      been implemented in different clinical applications. The commonly noninvasive 
      techniques used in neurological manipulations include photobiomodulation (PBM), 
      transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS), and ultrasound stimulation (USS). These techniques have the ability to 
      excite, inhibit, or modulate neuronal activity in targeted brain areas to obtain 
      the required therapeutic effects. However, each technique owns its unique 
      mechanism of action that relies on specific parameters suitable for treating 
      certain neurological disorders. Neurological disorders such as epilepsy, 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and depression have been 
      treated by one or more of these noninvasive techniques. The therapeutic outcomes 
      of these techniques for neurological diseases are promising, yet with 
      limitations. In the present review, the mechanisms of action of these different 
      brain stimulation/modulation modalities were explored and a synopsis of their 
      applications in the treatment of certain neurological disorders was provided. 
      Moreover, methodological issues, limitations, and open questions were presented. 
      Furthermore, some future directions were suggested.

      expectations of good outcomes, genetic variants, and personality. The presence of 
      motor fluctuation and high baseline UPDRS motor scores predicted placebo 
      response. However, gender, age, duration of PD, religion, or level of education 
      do not correlate with placebo response. PD patients who are preconditioned with 
      active treatment such as apomorphine have more robust placebo effects. Studies 
      that focused on patients with motor fluctuations, surgical intervention, or 
      higher probability of placebo assignment had higher rates of placebo response. 
      Patients view participating in placebo-controlled trials positively. Placebo 
      effect can be measured objectively using neuroimaging and neurophysiological 
      techniques. PET studies show that placebo-induced improvement is associated with 
      dopamine release in the dorsal striatum and that the expectation of receiving the 
      reward, not the reward itself, increased dopamine release in the ventral 
      striatum. Expectations of benefitting from repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation also induced dopamine release. Expectations of receiving a 
      dopaminergic drug induced changes in fMRI in a reward-learning task. Single cell 
      recordings demonstrate that placebo response is associated with changes of single 
      neuronal activities in the basal ganglia circuit. These studies demonstrate that 
      placebo effects are genuine biological responses to the administration of 
      placebo. In clinical trials, we can use several approaches to minimize placebo 
      responses. In clinical practice, we can use approaches to harness the power of 
      placebo and minimize nocebo effects to improve patients' outcome.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a complex neurodegenerative 
      disorder, characterized by a wide range of pathological conditions associated 
      with the buildup of proteins such as tau and TDP-43. With a strong hereditary 
      component, FTD often results from genetic variants in three genes - MAPT, GRN, 
      and C9orf72. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors explore abnormal protein 
      accumulation in FTD and forthcoming treatments, providing a detailed analysis of 
      new diagnostic advancements, including innovative markers. They analyze how these 
      discoveries have influenced therapeutic strategies, particularly 
      disease-modifying treatments, which could potentially transform FTD management. 
      This comprehensive exploration of FTD from its molecular underpinnings to its 
      therapeutic prospects offers a compelling overview of the current state of FTD 
      research. EXPERT OPINION: Notable challenges in FTD management involve 
      identifying reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and response monitoring. 
      Genetic forms of FTD, particularly those linked to C9orf72 and GRN, show promise, 
      with targeted therapies resulting in substantial progress in disease-modifying 
      strategies. The potential of neuromodulation techniques, like tDCS and rTMS, is 
      being explored, requiring further study. Ongoing trials and multi-disciplinary 
      care highlight the continued push toward effective FTD treatments. With 
      increasing understanding of FTD's molecular and clinical intricacies, the hope 
      for developing effective interventions grows.

TI  - Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Motor Symptoms in 
      Parkinson's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 395-404
LID - 10.1177/15459683221095034 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive 
      neuromodulation technique that has been closely examined as a possible treatment 
      for Parkinson's disease (PD). Owing to various rTMS protocols and results, the 
      optimal mode and suitable PD symptoms have yet to be established. OBJECTIVES: 
      This study intends to systematically evaluate the efficacy of rTMS intervention 
      and identify optimal stimulation protocol of rTMS for specific motor symptoms. 
      METHODS: PubMed and web of Science databases were searched before January 2022. 
      Eligible studies included sham-controlled and randomized clinical trials of rTMS 
      intervention for motor dysfunction in patients with PD. Standard mean difference 
      (SMD) was calculated with random-effects models. The effects of rTMS on motor 
      symptoms were mainly estimated by the UPDRS-III. RESULTS: A total of 1172 
      articles were identified, of which 32 articles met the inclusion criteria for 
      meta-analysis. The pooled evidence suggested that rTMS relieves motor symptoms of 
      patients with PD (SMD 0.64, 95%CI [0.47, 0.80]). High frequency stimulation on M1 
      is the most effective mode of intervention (SMD 0.79, 95%CI [0.52, 1.07]). HF 
      rTMS has significant therapeutic effects on limbs motor function (SMD 1.93, 95%CI 
      [0.73, 3.12] for upper limb function and SMD 0.88, 95%CI [0.43, 1.33] for lower 
      limb function), akinesia (SMD 1.17, 95%CI [0.43, 1.92), rigidity (SMD 1.02, 95%CI 
      [0.12, 1.92]) and tremor(SMD 0.91, 95%CI [0.15, 1.67]). CONCLUSION: rTMS therapy 
      is an effective treatment for motor symptoms of PD and the individualized 
      stimulation protocols for different symptoms would further improve its clinical 
      efficacy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several studies have reported repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) therapy as an effective treatment for the control of motor 
      symptoms in Parkinson disease. The objective of the study is to quantify the 
      overall efficacy of this treatment. TYPES: Systematic review and meta-analysis. 
      LITERATURE SURVEY: We reviewed the literature on clinical rTMS trials in 
      Parkinson disease since the technique was introduced in 1980. We used the 
      following databases: MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane, and CINAHL. PATIENTS AND 
      SETTING: Patients with Parkinson disease who were participating in prospective 
      clinical trials that included an active arm and a control arm and change in motor 
      scores on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale as the primary outcome. We 
      pooled data from 21 studies that met these criteria. We then analyzed separately 
      the effects of low- and high-frequency rTMS on clinical motor improvements. 
      SYNTHESIS: The overall pooled mean difference between treatment and control 
      groups in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score was 
      significant (4.0 points, 95% confidence interval, 1.5, 6.7; P = .005). rTMS 
      therapy was effective when low-frequency stimulation (≤ 1 Hz) was used with a 
      pooled mean difference of 3.3 points (95% confidence interval 1.6, 5.0; P = 
      .005). There was a trend for significance when high-frequency stimulation (≥ 5 
      Hz) studies were evaluated with a pooled mean difference of 3.9 points (95% 
      confidence interval, -0.7, 8.5; P = .08). rTMS therapy demonstrated benefits at 
      short-term follow-up (immediately after a treatment protocol) with a pooled mean 
      difference of 3.4 points (95% confidence interval, 0.3, 6.6; P = .03) as well as 
      at long-term follow-up (average follow-up 6 weeks) with mean difference of 4.1 
      points (95% confidence interval, -0.15, 8.4; P = .05). There were insufficient 
      data to statistically analyze the effects of rTMS when we specifically examined 
      bradykinesia, gait, and levodopa-induced dyskinesia using quantitative methods. 
      CONCLUSION: rTMS therapy in patients with Parkinson disease results in 
      mild-to-moderate motor improvements and has the potential to be used as an 
      adjunct therapy for the treatment of Parkinson disease. Future large, sample 
      studies should be designed to isolate the specific clinical features of Parkinson 
      disease that respond well to rTMS therapy.

AB  - We review the motor cortical and basal ganglia involvement in two important 
      movement disorders: Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia. Single and paired 
      pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation studies showed altered excitability and 
      cortical circuits in PD with decreased silent period, short interval 
      intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation, long afferent inhibition, 
      interhemispheric inhibition, and cerebellar inhibition, and increased long 
      interval intracortical inhibition and short interval intracortical facilitation. 
      In dystonia, there is decreased silent period, short interval intracortical 
      inhibition, long afferent inhibition, interhemispheric inhibition, and increased 
      intracortical facilitation. Plasticity induction protocols revealed deficient 
      plasticity in PD and normal and exaggerated plasticity in dystonia. In the basal 
      ganglia, there is increased β (14-30Hz) rhythm in PD and characteristic 5-18Hz 
      band synchronization in dystonia. These motor cortical circuits, cortical 
      plasticity, and oscillation profiles of the basal ganglia are altered with 
      medications and deep brain stimulation treatment. There is considerable 
      variability in these measures related to interindividual variations, different 
      disease characteristics, and methodological considerations. Nevertheless, these 
      pathophysiologic studies have expanded our knowledge of cortical excitability, 
      plasticity, and oscillations in PD and dystonia, improved our understanding of 
      disease pathophysiology, and helped to develop new treatments for these 
      conditions.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation as a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Tool in Various 
      Types of Dementia.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10132875 [doi]
LID - 2875
AB  - Dementia is recognized as a healthcare and social burden and remains challenging 
      in terms of proper diagnosis and treatment. Transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS) is a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in various neurological diseases that 
      noninvasively investigates cortical excitability and connectivity and can induce 
      brain plasticity. This article reviews findings on TMS in common dementia types 
      as well as therapeutic results. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by 
      increased cortical excitability and reduced cortical inhibition, especially as 
      mediated by cholinergic neurons and as documented by impairment of short latency 
      inhibition (SAI). In vascular dementia, excitability is also increased. SAI may 
      have various outcomes, which probably reflects its frequent overlap with AD. 
      Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is associated with SAI decrease. Motor cortical 
      excitability is usually normal, reflecting the lack of corticospinal tract 
      involvement. DLB and other dementia types are also characterized by impairment of 
      short interval intracortical inhibition. In frontotemporal dementia, cortical 
      excitability is increased, but SAI is normal. Repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation has the potential to improve cognitive function. It has been 
      extensively studied in AD, showing promising results after multisite stimulation. 
      TMS with electroencephalography recording opens new possibilities for improving 
      diagnostic accuracy; however, more studies are needed to support the existing 
      data.

TI  - Neuroprotection and Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation: Facts or Fiction?
LID - 10.3390/ijms232213775 [doi]
LID - 13775
AB  - Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial Direct 
      Current Stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive Magnetic Transcranial Stimulation 
      (rTMS), are well-known non-pharmacological approaches to improve both motor and 
      non-motor symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Their use is of 
      particular interest especially for the treatment of cognitive impairment in 
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as axial disturbances in Parkinson's (PD), 
      where conventional pharmacological therapies show very mild and short-lasting 
      effects. However, their ability to interfere with disease progression over time 
      is not well understood; recent evidence suggests that NIBS may have a 
      neuroprotective effect, thus slowing disease progression and modulating the 
      aggregation state of pathological proteins. In this narrative review, we gather 
      current knowledge about neuroprotection and NIBS in neurodegenerative diseases 
      (i.e., PD and AD), just mentioning the few results related to stroke. As further 
      matter of debate, we discuss similarities and differences with Deep Brain 
      Stimulation (DBS)-induced neuroprotective effects, and highlight possible future 
      directions for ongoing clinical studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lewy body dementias (LBD) include both dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) 
      and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), and the differentiation of LBD from 
      other neurodegenerative dementias can be difficult. Currently, there are few 
      biomarkers which might assist early diagnosis, map onto LBD symptom severity, and 
      provide metrics of treatment response. Traditionally, biomarkers in LBD have 
      focussed on neuroimaging modalities; however, as biomarkers need to be simple, 
      inexpensive and non-invasive, neurophysiological approaches might also be useful 
      as LBD biomarkers. METHODS: In this review, we searched PubMED and PsycINFO 
      databases in a semi-systematic manner in order to identify potential 
      neurophysiological biomarkers in the LBDs. RESULTS: We identified 1491 studies; 
      of these, 37 studies specifically examined neurophysiological biomarkers in LBD 
      patients. We found that there was substantial heterogeneity with respect to 
      methodologies and patient cohorts. CONCLUSION: Generally, many of the findings 
      have yet to be replicated, although preliminary findings reinforce the potential 
      utility of approaches such as quantitative electroencephalography and motor 
      cortical stimulation paradigms. SIGNIFICANCE: Various neurophysiological 
      techniques have the potential to be useful biomarkers in the LBDs. We recommend 
      that future studies focus on maximising the diagnostic specificity and 
      sensitivity of the most promising neurophysiological biomarkers.

AB  - Noninvasive electrical stimulation of the human brain first was attempted in the 
      1950s. In the early 1980s, the first clinical application method of transcranial 
      electrical stimulation was developed. Investigators in the mid-1980s showed that 
      it was possible to stimulate the nerve and the brain using external magnetic 
      stimulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS]), with little or no pain. 
      TMS now is used commonly in clinical neurology to study central motor conduction 
      time. Depending on the stimulation techniques and parameters, TMS can excite or 
      inhibit brain activity, allowing functional mapping of cortical regions and 
      creation of transient functional lesions. It now is used widely as a research 
      tool to study aspects of human brain physiology, including motor function and the 
      pathophysiology of various brain disorders.

AB  - This chapter reviews the alterations in motor learning and motor cortical 
      plasticity in Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common movement disorder. 
      Impairments in motor learning, which is a hallmark of basal ganglia disorders, 
      influence the performance of motor learning-related behavioral tasks and have 
      clinical implications for the management of disturbance in gait and posture, and 
      for rehabilitative management of PD. Although plasticity is classically induced 
      and assessed in sliced preparation in animal models, in this review we have 
      concentrated on the results from non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such 
      as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial alternating current 
      stimulation (tACS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in patients 
      with PD, in addition to a few animal electrophysiologic studies. The chapter 
      summarizes the results from different cortical and subcortical plasticity 
      investigations. Plasticity induction protocols reveal deficient plasticity in PD 
      and these plasticity measures are modulated by medications and deep brain 
      stimulation. There is considerable variability in these measures that are related 
      to inter-individual variations, different disease characteristics and 
      methodological considerations. Nevertheless, these pathophysiologic studies 
      expand our knowledge of cortical excitability, plasticity and the effects of 
      different treatments in PD. These tools of modulating plasticity and motor 
      learning improve our understanding of PD pathophysiology and help to develop new 
      treatments for this disabling condition.

AB  - Cognitive impairments and depression are common non-motor manifestations in 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent evidence suggests that both partially arise via 
      the same frontostriatal network, opening the opportunity for concomitant 
      treatment with non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS). In this systematic review, we evaluate the effects of 
      NIBS on cognition and/or mood in 19 placebo-controlled studies involving 561 PD 
      patients. Outcomes depended on the area stimulated and the technique used. rTMS 
      over the dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) resulted in significant 
      reductions in scores of depressive symptoms with moderate to large effect sizes 
      along with increased performance in several tests of cognitive functions. tDCS 
      over the DLPFC improved performance in several cognitive measures, including 
      executive functions with large effect sizes. Additional effects of tDCS on mood 
      were not detectable; however, only non-depressed patients were assessed. Further 
      confirmatory research is needed to clarify the contribution that NIBS could make 
      in the care of PD patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive 
      neurophysiological tool that provides important insights into Alzheimer's Disease 
      (AD). A significant body of work utilizing TMS techniques has explored the 
      pathophysiological relevance of cortical hyperexcitability and plasticity in AD 
      and their modulation in novel therapies. AREAS COVERED: This review examines the 
      technique of TMS, the use of TMS to examine specific features of cortical 
      excitability and the use of TMS techniques to modulate cortical function. A 
      search was performed utilizing the PubMed database to identify key studies 
      utilizing TMS to examine cortical hyperexcitability and plasticity in Alzheimer's 
      dementia. We then translate this understanding to the study of Alzheimer's 
      disease pathophysiology, examining the underlying neurophysiologic links 
      contributing to these twin signatures, cortical hyperexcitability and abnormal 
      plasticity, in the cortical dysfunction characterizing AD. Finally, we examine 
      utilization of TMS excitability to guide targeted therapies and, through the use 
      of repetitive TMS (rTMS), modulate cortical plasticity. EXPERT OPINION: The 
      examination of cortical hyperexcitability and plasticity with TMS has potential 
      to optimize and expand the window of therapeutic interventions in AD, though 
      remains at relatively early stage of development.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) is a clinical syndrome that encompasses a wide spectrum 
      of cognitive disorders caused by cerebrovascular disease. The subcortical 
      ischemic form of VaD is clinically homogeneous and a major cause of cognitive 
      impairment in the elderly. Vascular lesions contribute to cognitive decline in 
      neurodegenerative dementias, and VaD and Alzheimer's disease often coexist and 
      share clinical features and multiple neurotransmission involvement. These 
      similarities have led several investigators to use transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (TMS) to enucleate a neurophysiological profile of VaD. TMS studies 
      have identified a pattern of cortical hyperexcitability probably related to the 
      disruption of the integrity of white matter lesions due to cerebrovascular 
      disease. The present review provides a perspective of these TMS techniques by 
      further understanding the role of different neurotransmission pathways and 
      plastic remodeling of neuronal networks in the pathogenesis of VaD.

      Effects and Future Perspectives.
PG  - 763-775

AB  - In this review, we discuss the clinical and electrophysiological effects and the 
      future directions of invasive and noninvasive brain stimulations in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can improve motor symptoms in moderate 
      to advanced PD. However, the optimal stimulation paradigm for nonmotor symptoms 
      (NMS), freezing of gait, and the optimal timing of DBS are still under 
      investigation. The findings of pathological oscillations and abnormal frequency 
      to amplitude coupling provide models to develop adaptive DBS. Transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) revealed abnormal cortical excitability and plasticity 
      in PD. Consecutive sessions of high-frequency, repetitive TMS on the motor cortex 
      showed promising results. Paired TMS and DBS at specific times provided a novel 
      way to investigate PD pathophysiology and have potential as a future treatment. 
      Transcranial direct current stimulation or transcranial alternating current 
      stimulation with multifocal electrodes or at specific phases of oscillation are 
      also potential future strategies.

TI  - Multisite non-invasive brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease: A scoping 
      review.
PG  - 515-531
LID - 10.3233/NRE-210190 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, 
      characterized by cardinal motor symptoms in addition to cognitive impairment. New 
      insights concerning multisite non-invasive brain stimulation effects have been 
      gained, which can now be used to develop innovative treatment approaches. 
      OBJECTIVE: Map the researchs involving multisite non-invasive brain stimulation 
      in PD, synthesize the available evidence and discuss future directions. METHODS: 
      The databases PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS and The Cochrane Library were 
      searched from inception until April 2020, without restrictions on the date of 
      publication or the language in which it was published. The reviewers worked in 
      pairs and sequentially evaluated the titles, abstracts and then the full text of 
      all publications identified as potentially relevant. RESULTS: Twelve articles met 
      the inclusion criteria. The target brain regions included mainly the combination 
      of a motor and a frontal area, such as stimulation of the primary motor córtex 
      associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Most of the trials showed 
      that this modality was only more effective for the motor component, or for the 
      cognitive and/or non-motor, separately. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the results being 
      encouraging for the use of the multisite aproach, the indication for PD 
      management should be carried out with caution and deserves scientific deepening.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a pivotal noninvasive 
      technique for investigating cortical excitability and plasticity across the 
      lifespan, offering valuable insights into neurodevelopmental and 
      neurodegenerative processes. In this review, we explore the impact of TMS 
      applications on our understanding of normal development, healthy aging, 
      neurodevelopmental disorders, and adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. By 
      presenting key developmental milestones and age-related changes in TMS measures, 
      we provide a foundation for understanding the maturation of neurotransmitter 
      systems and the trajectory of cognitive functions throughout the lifespan. 
      Building on this foundation, the paper delves into the pathophysiology of 
      neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, and adolescent 
      depression. Highlighting recent findings on altered neurotransmitter circuits and 
      dysfunctional cortical plasticity, we underscore the potential of TMS as a 
      valuable tool for unraveling underlying mechanisms and informing future 
      therapeutic interventions. We also review the emerging role of TMS in 
      investigating and treating the most common adult-onset neurodegenerative 
      disorders and late-onset depression. By outlining the therapeutic applications of 
      noninvasive brain stimulation techniques in these disorders, we discuss the 
      growing body of evidence supporting their use as therapeutic tools for symptom 
      management and potentially slowing disease progression. The insights gained from 
      TMS studies have advanced our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in both 
      healthy and disease states, ultimately informing the development of more targeted 
      diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for a wide range of neuropsychiatric 
      conditions.

AB  - Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques can be used to study in vivo the changes 
      of cortical activity and plasticity in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
      Also, an increasing number of studies have suggested a potential therapeutic 
      effect of these techniques. High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) 
      represent the most used stimulation paradigms to treat motor and nonmotor 
      symptoms of PD. Both techniques can enhance cortical activity, compensating for 
      its reduction related to subcortical dysfunction in PD. However, the use of 
      suboptimal stimulation parameters can lead to therapeutic failure. Clinical 
      studies are warranted to clarify in PD the additional effects of these 
      stimulation techniques on pharmacologic and neurorehabilitation treatments.

AB  - This study aimed to review the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) for Parkinson's disease (PD). rTMS can modulate the neural 
      networks in the human brain for a certain period, i.e., it can induce neural 
      plasticity. Randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter studies on 
      rTMS for PD have been conducted three times in Japan (in 2003, 2008, and 2013). 
      These studies revealed that 5-Hz rTMS over the supplementary motor area (SMA) is 
      the most effective modality for improving motor symptoms. Several functional 
      imaging studies showed reduced SMA excitability in patients with PD, probably 
      secondary to basal ganglia dysfunction. Therefore, 5-Hz rTMS is assumed to 
      normalize SMA excitability and amend basal ganglia function secondarily. 
      Currently, a phase III trial is being conducted in Japan. Therefore, in the near 
      future, 5-Hz rTMS can be used as a therapeutic modality for PD treatment. In 
      addition, several powerful rTMS have been developed recently, including 
      quadripulse stimulation (QPS), which most potently induces neural plasticity. QPS 
      is also expected to be a potential therapeutic tool to treat patients with PD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is widely used to 
      treat Alzheimer's Disease. However, the effect of rTMS is still controversial. 
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of rTMS on 
      cognitive performance of AD patients. METHODS: We systematically searched 
      relevant literatures in four major databases - PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, 
      and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [Central] before 28 (th) 
      April 2022. Both randomized controlled trials and cross-section studies that 
      compared the therapeutic effect of rTMS with blank control or sham stimuli were 
      included. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies involving 513 AD patients were finally 
      included for meta-analysis. It was found that rTMS significantly improved global 
      cognitive function (SMD = 0.24, 95%CI, 0.12 to 0.36, P = 0.0001) and daily living 
      ability (IADL: SMD = 0.64, 95%CI, 0.21to 1.08, P = 0.004) in patients with AD, 
      but did not show improvement in language, memory, executive ability, and mood. In 
      further analyses, rTMS at 10 Hz, on a single target with 20 sessions of treatment 
      was shown to produce a positive effect. In addition, improvement in cognitive 
      functions lasted for at least 6 weeks (SMD = 0.67, 95%CI, 0.05 to 1.30,P = 0.04). 
      CONCLUSION: rTMS can improve the global cognition and daily living ability of AD 
      patients. In addition, attention should be paid to the safety of rTMS in AD 
      patients with seizures. Given the relatively small sample size, our results 
      should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a method of 
      Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation that is based on electro-physical principles 
      discovered by Michael Faraday. A TMS device is made of one or two copper coils, 
      positioned superficially to a site of interest in the brain, to non-invasively 
      produce a brief magnetic pulse to an estimated depth from the surface of the 
      scalp with the following axonal depolarization. This axonal depolarization 
      activates cortical and subcortical networks with multiple effects. There are 
      different methods of TMS used, all with different mechanisms of action. TMS is 
      well tolerated with very few side effects. RECENT FINDINGS: TMS is now approved 
      for major depression disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is 
      significant data to consider approval of TMS for many neurological disorders. 
      This is a review of the uses of TMS in diverse neurological conditions, including 
      stroke and spasticity, migraine, and dementia. TMS is a device that utilizes 
      non-invasive brain stimulation, and it has shown promising results with objective 
      clinical and basic science data. Its ability to trigger neuronal plasticity and 
      potentiating synaptic transmission gives it incredible therapeutic potential. 
      There are diverse mechanisms of action, and this could be troublesome in 
      elaborating clinical trials and standardization of therapy.

      Alzheimer's disease (Review).

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
      cognitive decline and brain neuronal loss. A pioneering field of research in AD 
      is brain stimulation via electromagnetic fields (EMFs), which may produce 
      clinical benefits. Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS), have been developed to treat neurological and 
      psychiatric disorders. The purpose of the present review is to identify 
      neurobiological changes, including inflammatory, neurodegenerative, apoptotic, 
      neuroprotective and genetic changes, which are associated with repetitive TMS 
      (rTMS) treatment in patients with AD. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate the effect 
      of TMS treatment in patients with AD and to identify the associated mechanisms. 
      The present review highlights the changes in inflammatory and apoptotic 
      mechanisms, mitochondrial enzymatic activities, and modulation of gene expression 
      (microRNA expression profiles) associated with rTMS or sham procedures. At the 
      molecular level, it has been suggested that EMFs generated by TMS may affect the 
      cell redox status and amyloidogenic processes. TMS may also modulate gene 
      expression by acting on both transcriptional and post‑transcriptional regulatory 
      mechanisms. TMS may increase brain cortical excitability, induce specific 
      potentiation phenomena, and promote synaptic plasticity and recovery of impaired 
      functions; thus, it may re‑establish cognitive performance in patients with AD.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in Mild Cognitive Impairment: 
      Effects on Cognitive Functions-A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/jcm12196190 [doi]
LID - 6190
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain 
      stimulation technique also used as a non-pharmacological intervention against 
      cognitive impairment. The purpose of the present review was to summarize what is 
      currently known about the effectiveness of rTMS intervention on different 
      cognitive domains in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to address 
      potential neuromodulation approaches in combination with electroencephalography 
      (EEG) and neuroimaging, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 
      In this systematic review, we consulted three main databases (PubMed, Science 
      Direct, and Scopus), and Google Scholar was selected for the gray literature 
      search. The PRISMA flowchart drove the studies' inclusion. The selection process 
      ensured that only high-quality studies were included; after removing duplicate 
      papers, explicit ratings were given based on the quality classification as high 
      (A), moderate (B), or low (C), considering factors such as risks of bias, 
      inaccuracies, inconsistencies, lack of direction, and publication bias. Seven 
      full-text articles fulfilled the stated inclusion, reporting five double-blind, 
      randomized, sham-controlled studies, a case study, and a randomized crossover 
      trial. The results of the reviewed studies suggested that rTMS in MCI patients is 
      safe and effective for enhancing cognitive functions, thus making it a potential 
      therapeutic approach for MCI patients. Changes in functional connectivity within 
      the default mode network (DMN) after targeted rTMS could represent a valuable 
      indicator of treatment response. Finally, high-frequency rTMS over the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been shown to significantly enhance 
      cognitive functions, such as executive performance, together with the increase of 
      functional connectivity within frontoparietal networks. The main limitations were 
      the number of included studies and the exclusion of studies using intermittent 
      theta-burst stimulation, used in studies on Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, 
      neuroimaging techniques in combination with rTMS have been shown to be useful for 
      future network-based, fMRI-guided therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Stroke is a common cerebrovascular disease with high morbidity, mortality, and 
      disability worldwide. Post-stroke dysfunction is related to the death of neurons 
      and impairment of synaptic structure, which results from cerebral ischemic 
      damage. Currently, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques are 
      available to provide clinically effective interventions and quantitative 
      diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The development of TMS has been 40 years 
      and a range of repetitive TMS (rTMS) protocols are now available to regulate 
      neuronal plasticity in many neurological disorders, such as stroke, Parkinson 
      disease, psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer disease, and so on. Basic studies in an 
      animal model with ischemic stroke are significant for demonstrating potential 
      mechanisms of neural restoration induced by rTMS. In this review, the mechanisms 
      were summarized, involving synaptic plasticity, neural cell death, neurogenesis, 
      immune response, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in vitro and vivo 
      experiments with ischemic stroke models. Those findings can contribute to the 
      understanding of how rTMS modulated function recovery and the exploration of 
      novel therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of rTMS in treating ischemic stroke 
      from animal models. rTMS can prompt synaptic plasticity by increasing NMDAR, 
      AMPAR and BDNF expression; rTMS can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and 
      facilitate the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 by shifting 
      astrocytic phenotypes from A1 to A2, and shifting microglial phenotypes from M1 
      to M2; rTMS facilitated the release of angiogenesis-related factors TGFβ and VEGF 
      in A2 astrocytes, which can contribute to vasculogenesis and angiogenesis; rTMS 
      can suppress apoptosis by increasing Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting Bax, 
      caspase-3 expression; rTMS can also suppress pyroptosis by decreasing caspase-1, 
      IL-1β, ASC, GSDMD and NLRP1 expression. rTMS, repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors; AMPAR:

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive form of brain 
      stimulation that makes use of the magnetic field generated when an electric 
      current passes through a magnetic coil placed over the scalp. It can be applied 
      as a single stimulus at a time, in pairs of stimuli, or repetitively in trains of 
      stimuli (repetitive TMS, rTMS). RTMS can induce changes in brain activity, whose 
      after-effects reflect the processes of long-term potentiation and long-term 
      depression, as certain protocols, namely those using low frequencies (≤1 Hz) seem 
      to suppress cortical excitability, while those using high frequencies (>1 Hz) 
      seem to enhance it. It is a technique with very few and mostly mild side-effects, 
      whose effects can persist for long time periods, and as such, it has been studied 
      as a potential treatment option in a multitude of neurodegenerative diseases, 
      including those affecting movement. Although rTMS has received approval as a 
      treatment strategy of only a few aspects in movement disorders in the latest 
      guidelines, its further use seems to also be promising in their context. In this 
      review, we gathered the available literature on the therapeutic application of 
      rTMS in movement disorders, namely Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral 
      Sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Dystonia, Tic disorders and Essential Tremor.

AB  - This study reviews the use of magnetic and electromagnetic fields (EMF), pulsed 
      electromagnetic fields (PEMF), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 
      Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), or Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The 
      Introduction provides a review of EMF, PEMF, and TMS based on clinical 
      observations. This is followed by a description of the basic principles of these 
      treatments and a literature review on possible mechanisms describing the coupling 
      of these treatments with biological responses. These response mechanisms include 
      the cell membrane and its embedded receptors, channels and pumps, as well as 
      signaling cascades within the cell and links to cell organelles. We also discuss 
      the magnetic contribution to coupling EMF, as well as the recent finding of 
      cryptochrome as a putative magnetosensor. Our conclusion summarizes the complex 
      network of causal factors elicited by EMF such as those arising from the cell 
      membrane via signaling cascades to radical oxygen species, nitric oxide, growth 
      factors, cryptochromes and other mechanisms involving epigenetic and genetic 
      changes.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive brain 
      stimulation technique, has been considered as a potentially effective treatment 
      for the cognitive impairment in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the effectiveness of this therapy is still 
      under debate due to the variety of rTMS parameters and individual differences 
      including distinctive stages of AD in the previous studies. The current 
      meta-analysis is aiming to assess the cognitive enhancement of rTMS treatment on 
      patients of MCI and early AD. Three datasets (PubMed, Web of Science and CKNI) 
      were searched with relative terms and finally twelve studies with 438 
      participants (231 in the rTMS group and 207 in the control group) in thirteen 
      randomized, double-blind and controlled trials were included. Random effects 
      analysis revealed that rTMS stimulation significantly introduced cognitive 
      benefits in patients of MCI and early AD compared with the control group (mean 
      effect size, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.76 - 1.57). Most settings of rTMS parameters 
      (frequency, session number, stimulation site number) significantly enhanced 
      global cognitive function, and the results revealed that protocols with 10 Hz 
      repetition frequency and DLPFC as the stimulation site for 20 sessions can 
      already be able to produce cognitive improvement. The cognitive enhancement of 
      rTMS could last for one month after the end of treatment and patients with MCI 
      were likely to benefit more from the rTMS stimulation. Our meta-analysis added 
      important evidence to the cognitive enhancement of rTMS in patients with MCI and 
      early AD and discussed potential underlying mechanisms about the effect induced 
      by rTMS.

AB  - CONTEXT: Depression affects 50-70% of patients with Parkinson's disease resulting 
      in significant comorbidity, executive dysfunction, and poorer quality of life. 
      Divergent results from studies of different treatments preclude definite 
      treatment recommendations. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials (RCTS) evaluating the 
      efficacy of pharmacologic and behavioral interventions, and repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for depression among patients with 
      idiopathic Parkinson's disease. DATA SOURCES: Trial registers and the following 
      databases were searched: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycInfo. Bibliographies of 
      relevant articles were cross-referenced. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: 
      RCTs comparing pharmacologic, behavioral, or rTMS with a placebo/other drugs or 
      methods with no restrictions on participant age, gender, and duration or setting 
      of treatment were included. Eligibility assessment was performed independently. 
      Identified records were sequentially screened according to eligibility criteria. 
      Differences in mean depression score and 95% confidence intervals were 
      calculated. RESULTS: A total of 893 idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients with 
      clinical depression across 20 RCTs were included. The overall standard mean 
      difference for all pharmacologic interventions was 0.30 (95% CI -0.00, 0.61, p = 
      0.054). On stratification, there was a distinct difference in effect between 
      antidepressants (SMD of 0.54, 95%CI 0.24, 0.83, p = 0.000) and 
      non-antidepressants (SMD of -0.29, 95% CI -0.86, 0.29, p = 0.328). Behavioral 
      interventions demonstrated significant efficacy with an effect size of 0.87 (95% 
      CI 0.41, 1.33, p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrates that 
      pharmacologic treatment with antidepressant medications, specifically the 
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and behavioral interventions 
      (CBT) significantly improved depression among Parkinson's disease patients.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an accessible, non-invasive technique 
      to study cortical function in vivo. TMS studies have provided important 
      pathophysiological insights across a range of neurodegenerative disorders and 
      enhanced our understanding of brain reorganisation after stroke. In 
      neurodegenerative disease, TMS has provided novel insights into the function of 
      cortical output cells and the related intracortical interneuronal networks. 
      Characterisation of cortical hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      and altered motor cortical function in frontotemporal dementia, demonstration of 
      cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are key 
      examples where TMS has led to advances in understanding of disease 
      pathophysiology and potential mechanisms of propagation, with the potential for 
      diagnostic applications. In stroke, TMS methodology has facilitated the 
      understanding of cortical reorganisation that underlie functional recovery. These 
      insights are critical to the development of effective and targeted rehabilitation 
      strategies in stroke. The present review will provide an overview of cortical 
      function measures obtained using TMS and how such measures may provide insight 
      into brain function. Through an improved understanding of cortical function 
      across a range of neurodegenerative disorders, and identification of changes in 
      neural structure and function associated with stroke that underlie clinical 
      recovery, more targeted therapeutic approaches may now be developed in an 
      evolving era of precision medicine.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that the clinical effects of transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation are target dependent. Within any given symptom, precise targeting of 
      specific brain circuits may improve clinical outcomes. This principle can also be 
      extended across symptoms-stimulation of different circuits may lead to different 
      symptom-level outcomes. This may include targeting different symptoms within the 
      same disorder (such as dysphoria vs. anxiety in patients with major depression) 
      or targeting the same symptom across different disorders (such as primary major 
      depression and depression secondary to stroke, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, 
      multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease). Some of these symptom-specific 
      changes may be desirable, while others may be undesirable. This review focuses on 
      the conceptual framework through which symptom-specific target circuits may be 
      identified, tested, and implemented.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia is an immense personal and public 
      health burden. Available treatments have modest efficacy in reducing symptoms of 
      AD and have no significant impact on the course of the illness. Moreover, 
      attempts to discover novel treatments have to date failed. Noninvasive brain 
      stimulation comprises a suite of interventions that are based on transcranial 
      magnetic or electric stimulation of different brain regions. Promising findings 
      are emerging from two forms of noninvasive brain stimulation: repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS). Here, the results from the randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) that assessed rTMS or tDCS in AD or in mild cognitive impairment, a 
      clinical state that typically preceded AD, are reviewed. Overall, there are few 
      RCTs, and most of them are limited by small sample sizes. Larger RCTs and 
      additional research are needed to identify the best stimulation parameters for 
      these two interventions.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for multiple neurological 
      conditions in rodent animal models: A systematic review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive 
      neuromodulation technique. Recently, rTMS has shown promising therapeutic 
      potential in multiple neurological conditions. Nevertheless, challenges remain in 
      the clinical application of rTMS, which mainly due to the lack of consensus on 
      optimal stimulation protocols and poor understanding of the exact targets driving 
      its action. Experimental animal research with more controllable factors may 
      contribute to fill our knowledge gap in this area, and to accelerate the 
      development of clinical translation studies. Therefore, the current study was 
      designed to systematically review the effects of rTMS on animal models of certain 
      diseases and evaluate its potential mechanisms of action, which may guide future 
      studies aiming to improve the therapeutic utilization for these diseases. 
      METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted through the PubMed online 
      database on August 19, 2021. The search strategy consisted of two main 
      components: rTMS and stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), 
      and Parkinson's disease (PD), with results limited to animal studies. RESULTS: We 
      identified 41 animal studies, 21 that examined stroke, 8 that investigated 
      Alzheimer's disease, 5 that studied vascular dementia, and 7 that examined 
      Parkinson's disease, all of these studies were conducted in rodents (rat and 
      mice). Despite variations in study design and research methods, the therapeutic 
      benefits of rTMS, as reflected in the alleviation of disease-related symptoms and 
      pathological improvements, have been reported in these studies. rTMS induces 
      multi-directional changes at the cellular and molecular levels, including a 
      significant contribution to synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, the curative 
      effects of rTMS are related to stimulation parameters, with high-frequency rTMS 
      reported has better therapeutic efficacy in several studies. In terms of safety, 
      one study involving combination therapy reported the adverse effects of rTMS 
      administration. CONCLUSIONS: rTMS have shown encouraging therapeutic value in 
      rodent models of stroke, AD, VaD, and PD. Nonetheless, the optimal protocols and 
      exact target of action for this therapy remain to be determined. Correspondingly, 
      further research is still needed to bridge the translation gap between rodent 
      experiments and clinical application, which might lead to new directions in the 
      treatment of multiple neurological disorders.

AB  - The terms atypical parkinsonian disorders (APDs) and Parkinson plus syndromes are 
      mainly used to describe the four major entities of sporadic neuronal multisystem 
      degeneration: progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration 
      (CBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD). APDs 
      are characterized by a variety of symptoms and a lack of disease modifying 
      therapies; their treatment thus remains mainly symptomatic. Brain stimulation via 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and noninvasive 
      intervention using a magnetic coil, and it is considered an alternative therapy 
      in various neuropsychiatric pathologies. In this paper, we review the available 
      studies that investigate the efficacy of rTMS in the treatment of these APDs and 
      Parkinson plus syndromes. Τhe majority of the studies have shown beneficial 
      effects on motor and nonmotor symptoms, but research is still at a preliminary 
      phase, with large, double-blind studies lacking in the literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive 
      brain stimulation technique that is being actively explored as a potential 
      therapeutic modality in various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, 
      neuropathic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and neurodegenerative disorders, 
      including the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) approved rTMS for the treatment of major depression, 
      migraine-associated headaches, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The fact 
      that a significant proportion of patients suffering from these disorders fail to 
      respond to current pharmacological interventions indicates the need for 
      alternative therapies like rTMS. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to find and 
      summarize all studies combining the use of rTMS and pharmacological interference 
      in vitro, in order to facilitate future studies. METHODS: The results of studies 
      combining the use of rTMS with pharmacological interference in vitro were focused 
      on. The PubMed database was searched using the terms "rTMS", "repetitive", 
      "transcranial", "magnetic", "stimulation", "in vitro", "in vivo", "cell cultures" 
      untilMarch 2019 and 7 eligible studies were found. RESULTS: Overall results show 
      a synergistic effect of rTMS and pharmacotherapy in vitro with additive 
      effectiveness, better prognosis, and superior potential management. CONCLUSION: 
      The limited amount of knowledge denotes the need for additional in vitro studies 
      on the combination of rTMS and pharmacotherapy, which could be extended to in 
      vivo studies and ultimately help design clinical trials so as to improve the 
      therapeutic management of patients with a wide array of neuropsychiatric 
      disorders.

TI  - Fatigue in Parkinson's disease and potential interventions.
PG  - 25-34
LID - 10.3233/NRE-151238 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It 
      occurs at every stage of PD and affects quality of life. Fatigue severity worsens 
      over time as PD progresses, and it is associated with other non-motor symptoms 
      such as apathy, depression, sleep disorder, and cognitive dysfunction. PURPOSE: 
      In this literature review, I discuss the measurement and pathophysiology of 
      fatigue and fatigability. There are no evidence-based treatments for fatigue and 
      fatigability available. I review several pilot studies on the effects of 
      pharmacological agents and exercise on fatigue and fatigability. These studies 
      provide some insights on the design of future larger clinical trials. CONCLUSION: 
      Fatigue inventories including The Fatigue Severity Scale, the Multidimensional 
      Fatigue Inventory, or theParkinson Fatigue Scale are used to assess the severity 
      of fatigue. Finger tapping and force generation are useful in quantifying 
      physical fatigability. A reaction time paradigm such as the Attention Network 
      Test can be used to measure cognitive fatigability. Physical fatigability is 
      associated with the change in cortical excitability in PD measured by 
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Cognitive fatigability is most likely 
      associated with the neurotransmitter abnormalities (dopaminergic, cholinergic and 
      noradrenergic) in PD. Levodopa, modafanil, methylphenidate, and rasagiline may be 
      effective in treating fatigue and fatigability. Exercise programs may also be 
      effective.

AB  - Considering the limited effectiveness of drugs treatments in cognitive disorders, 
      the emergence of noninvasive techniques to modify brain function is very 
      interesting. Among these techniques, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (rTMS) can modulate cortical excitability and have potential therapeutic effects 
      on cognition and behaviour. These effects are due to physiological modifications 
      in the stimulated cortical tissue and their associated circuits, which depend on 
      the parameters of stimulation. The objective of this article is to specify 
      current knowledge and efficacy of rTMS in cognitive disorders. Previous studies 
      found very encouraging results with significant improvement of higher brain 
      functions. Nevertheless, these few studies have limits: a few patients were 
      enrolled, the lack of control of the mechanisms of action by brain imaging, 
      insufficiently formalized technique and variability of cognitive tests. It is 
      therefore necessary to perform more studies, which identify statistical 
      significant improvement and to specify underlying mechanisms of action and the 
      parameters of use of the rTMS to offer rTMS as a routine therapy for cognitive 
      dysfunction.

AB  - Corticobasal syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disorder, which presents with a 
      progressive, asymmetrical, akinetic rigid syndrome and early cortical signs. 
      However, clinical, pathological, and electrophysiological heterogeneity makes the 
      understanding of this syndrome challenging. Corticobasal syndrome can have 
      various pathological substrates including corticobasal degeneration, Alzheimer's 
      disease, Fronto-temporal degeneration with TDP inclusions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
      disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Furthermore, tools such as 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional neuroimaging techniques 
      like PET and SPECT have not been adequately used to supplement the 
      clinico-pathological heterogeneity. TMS studies in CBS have revealed changes in 
      cortical excitability and transcortical inhibition. Despite the availability of 
      more than 2 decades, its potential in CBS has not been fully utilized in studying 
      the cortical plasticity and effect of Levodopa on central neurophysiology. PET 
      and SPECT studies in CBS have shown abnormalities in regional glucose metabolism, 
      asymmetrical involvement of presynaptic dopaminergic system, and ascending 
      cholinergic connections to the cortex. While most studies have shown normal D2 
      receptor-binding activity in striatum of CBS cases, the results have not been 
      unanimous. Functional neuroimaging and TMS studies in CBS have shown the 
      involvement of GABAergic, muscarinic, and dopaminergic systems. In this review, 
      we aim to provide the current state of understanding of central neurophysiology 
      and neurochemistry of CBS using TMS and functional neuroimaging techniques. We 
      also highlight the heterogeneous nature of this disorder and the existing 
      knowledge gaps.

TI  - Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on motor symptoms in 
      Parkinson disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 432-40
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2014.4380 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive 
      neuromodulation technique that has been closely examined as a possible treatment 
      for Parkinson disease (PD). However, results evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS 
      in PD are mixed, mostly owing to low statistical power or variety in individual 
      rTMS protocols. OBJECTIVES: To determine the rTMS effects on motor dysfunction in 
      patients with PD and to examine potential factors that modulate the rTMS effects. 
      DATA SOURCES: Databases searched included PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, 
      Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from inception to June 30, 2014. STUDY 
      SELECTION: Eligible studies included sham-controlled, randomized clinical trials 
      of rTMS intervention for motor dysfunction in patients with PD. DATA EXTRACTION 
      AND SYNTHESIS: Relevant measures were extracted independently by 2 investigators. 
      Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated with random-effects models. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Motor examination of the Unified Parkinson's Disease 
      Rating Scale. RESULTS: Twenty studies with a total of 470 patients were included. 
      Random-effects analysis revealed a pooled SMD of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.29-0.64), 
      indicating an overall medium effect size favoring active rTMS over sham rTMS in 
      the reduction of motor symptoms (P<.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the 
      effect sizes estimated from high-frequency rTMS targeting the primary motor 
      cortex (SMD, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.46-1.08; P<.001) and low-frequency rTMS applied over 
      other frontal regions (SMD, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.13-0.87; P=.008) were significant. 
      The effect sizes obtained from the other 2 combinations of rTMS frequency and 
      rTMS site (ie, high-frequency rTMS at other frontal regions: SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, 
      -0.02 to 0.48, and low primary motor cortex: SMD, 0.28; 95% CI, -0.23 to 0.78) 
      were not significant. Meta-regression revealed that a greater number of pulses 
      per session or across sessions is associated with larger rTMS effects. Using the 
      Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria, we 
      characterized the quality of evidence presented in this meta-analysis as moderate 
      quality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The pooled evidence suggests that rTMS 
      improves motor symptoms for patients with PD. Combinations of rTMS site and 
      frequency as well as the number of rTMS pulses are key modulators of rTMS 
      effects. The findings of our meta-analysis may guide treatment decisions and 
      inform future research.

TI  - Treatment for depression comorbid with dementia.
PG  - 167-171
LID - 10.1136/ebmental-2019-300113 [doi]
AB  - Depression is a common comorbidity in dementia. Randomised controlled studies of 
      antidepressants do not show a significant improvement in depressive symptoms in 
      patients with comorbid dementia and are known to lead to an increase in side 
      effects. However, there are relatively few studies of depression in dementia, and 
      drawing firm conclusions about the use of antidepressants is limited by the 
      amount of data available. Furthermore, it is unclear whether data can be 
      extrapolated from similar populations (eg, those with late-life depression) to 
      inform pharmacotherapy in this patient group. Given the lack of effectiveness and 
      risk of side effects associated with pharmacological treatments, psychological 
      interventions may offer important therapeutic benefits. There is evidence for the 
      effectiveness of individual psychological therapy, and further research will 
      establish which psychological approach is the most effective. Some studies have 
      shown an improvement in depressive symptoms using structured sleep hygiene 
      programmes, exercise, arts interventions and music therapy. These studies are 
      hampered by small data sets, and the benefits to individuals may not be well 
      captured by standard outcome measures. At present, the best evidence for 
      arts-based approaches is in music therapy. Depression with comorbid dementia 
      responds well to electroconvulsive therapy and this is a useful treatment 
      modality for those with severe or life-threatening depressive symptoms. 
      Alternative neurostimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      are not widely used at present and further research is needed before they can be 
      a more widely used treatment modality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), especially repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), is a promising therapeutic tool for 
      managing the psychiatric symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). This meta-analysis 
      aims to assess the effect of NIBS on psychiatric symptoms in patients with PD. 
      METHODS: Several electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant 
      literature from inception to October 18, 2021. The therapeutic effects of NIBS 
      were evaluated using a random-effects meta-analysis based on the standard mean 
      difference (SMD) and multivariable-adjusted effect estimates and subgroup 
      analyses. Publication bias and sensitivity analyses were used to explore the 
      sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Finally, 57 and 15 studies with 4,010 
      participants were obtained from the meta-analysis and systematic review, 
      respectively. Significant differences were found between NIBS and 
      sham-stimulation/placebo participants for depression (SMD = -0.75, 95 % 
      confidence interval [CI]: -0.99 to -0.50, I(2) = 79 %), and rTMS combined with 
      antidepressant therapy and antidepressant alone for depression (SMD = -0.98, 95 % 
      CI: -1.37 to -0.59, I(2) = 87 %) and anxiety (SMD = -1.46, 95 % CI: -2.44 to 
      -0.48, I(2) = 95 %). Meanwhile, lower risks were observed for post-treatment 
      compared with pre-treatment for depression (relative risk [RR] = 0.66, 95 % CI: 
      0.57-0.76, I(2) = 96 %) and anxiety (RR = 0.66, 95 % CI: 0.60-0.73, I(2) = 67 %). 
      CONCLUSIONS: NIBS can be considered an effective non-pharmacological option for 
      treating PD depression; moreover, rTMS combined with antidepressants was 
      demonstrated to be a useful tool against depression and anxiety in PD.

AB  - Common neurodegenerative diseases include Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD). 
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive and painless method to 
      stimulate the human brain. Single- and paired-pulse TMS paradigms are powerful 
      ways to study the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Motor evoked potential studied with single-pulse TMS is increased in PD, AD and 
      ALS, but is decreased in HD. Changes in motor cortical excitability in 
      neurodegenerative diseases may be related to functional deficits in cortical 
      circuits or to compensatory mechanisms. Reduction or even absence of short 
      interval intracortical inhibition induced by paired-pulse TMS is common in 
      neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that there are functional impairments of 
      inhibitory cortical circuits. Decreased short latency afferent inhibition in AD, 
      PD and HD may be related to the cortical cholinergic deficits in these 
      conditions. Cortical plasticity tested by paired associative stimulation or theta 
      burst stimulation is impaired in PD, AD and HD. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) refers to 
      the application of trains of regularly repeating TMS pulses. High-frequency 
      facilitatory rTMS may improve motor symptoms in PD patients whereas low-frequency 
      inhibitory stimulation is a potential treatment for levodopa induced dyskinesia. 
      rTMS delivered both to the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex improves 
      memory in AD patients. Supplementary motor cortical stimulation in low frequency 
      may be useful for HD patients. However, the effects of treatment with multiple 
      sessions of rTMS for neurodegenerative diseases need to be tested in large, 
      sham-controlled studies in the future before they can be adopted for routine 
      clinical practice.

AB  - The exact relationship between cognitive functioning, cortical excitability, and 
      synaptic plasticity in dementia is not completely understood. Vascular cognitive 
      impairment (VCI) is deemed to be the most common cognitive disorder in the 
      elderly since it encompasses any degree of vascular-based cognitive decline. In 
      different cognitive disorders, including VCI, transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS) can be exploited as a noninvasive tool able to evaluate in vivo the 
      cortical excitability, the propension to undergo neural plastic phenomena, and 
      the underlying transmission pathways. Overall, TMS in VCI revealed enhanced 
      cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity that seem to correlate with the 
      disease process and progression. In some patients, such plasticity may be 
      considered as an adaptive response to disease progression, thus allowing the 
      preservation of motor programming and execution. Recent findings also point out 
      the possibility to employ TMS to predict cognitive deterioration in the so-called 
      "brains at risk" for dementia, which may be those patients who benefit more of 
      disease-modifying drugs and rehabilitative or neuromodulatory approaches, such as 
      those based on repetitive TMS (rTMS). Finally, TMS can be exploited to select the 
      responders to specific drugs in the attempt to maximize the response and to 
      restore maladaptive plasticity. While no single TMS index owns enough 
      specificity, a panel of TMS-derived measures can support VCI diagnosis and 
      identify early markers of progression into dementia. This work reviews all TMS 
      and rTMS studies on VCI. The aim is to evaluate how cortical excitability, 
      plasticity, and connectivity interact in the pathophysiology of the impairment 
      and to provide a translational perspective towards novel treatments of these 
      patients. Current pitfalls and limitations of both studies and techniques are 
      also discussed, together with possible solutions and future research agenda.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative condition 
      that significantly impacts both individuals and society. This study aims to 
      evaluate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) 
      as a treatment for AD by summarizing the evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) 
      and meta-analyses (MAs). METHODS: SRs/MAs of rTMS for AD were collected by 
      searching Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, CNKI, VIP, Sino-Med, 
      and Wanfang databases. The search was conducted from database creation to January 
      23, 2024. Methodological quality, reporting quality and risk of bias were 
      assessed using the Assessing Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 
      (AMSTAR-2), Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool and the Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). In addition, 
      the quality of evidence for outcome measures was assessed using the Grading of 
      Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS: Eight 
      SRs/MAs included in this study met the inclusion criteria. Based on the AMSTAR-2, 
      4 of the SRs/MA were classified as low quality, while the remaining 4 were deemed 
      to be of very low quality. The PRISMA analysis revealed that out of the 27 items 
      reporting, 16 achieved full reporting (100%). However, there were still some 
      deficiencies in reporting, particularly related to protocol and registration, 
      search strategy, risk of bias, and additional analysis. The ROBIS tool indicated 
      that only 3 SRs/MAs had a low risk of bias. The GRADE assessment indicated that 6 
      outcomes were of moderate quality (18.75%), 16 were of low quality (50%), and 10 
      were classified as very low quality (31.25%). CONCLUSION: Based on the evidence 
      collected, rTMS appears to be effective in improving cognitive function in AD 
      patients, although the methodological quality of the SRs/MAs reduces the 
      reliability of the conclusions and the overall quality is low. However, based on 
      the available results, we still support the value of rTMS as an intervention to 
      improve cognitive function in AD. In future studies, it is necessary to confirm 
      the efficacy of rTMS in AD patients and provide more reliable and scientific data 
      to contribute to evidence-based medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The short-term beneficial effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) on motor signs in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been addressed 
      by previous meta-analyses while its long-term effects remain undetermined. 
      Although deterioration of walking and upper limb function greatly affects the 
      participation in activities and quality of life of PD sufferers, the effect of 
      rTMS thereon has not been systematically studied. OBJECTIVE: This systematic 
      review aimed to examine the efficacy of rTMS on improving physical function and 
      motor signs over the short- and long-terms in people with PD. METHODS: Five 
      electronic databases were systematically searched for English language full-text 
      articles using relevant search terms. Only randomized placebo-controlled trials 
      investigating the effects of rTMS in PD were considered. The primary outcomes 
      were walking performance, upper limb function, and unified Parkinson's disease 
      rating scale (UPDRS) section III. Trials with similar outcomes were pooled by 
      calculating Hedges' g using random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-two trials 
      comprising 555 people with PD were included. Pooled estimates of effect of rTMS 
      indicated significantly improved short-term upper limb function (Hedges' g, 0.40, 
      P = 0.007), short-term (Hedges' g, 0.61, P = 0.03) and long-term walking 
      performance (Hedges' g, 0.89, P = 0.03), short-term (Hedges' g, 0.31, P = 0.003) 
      and long-term (Hedges' g, 0.54, P = 0.003) UPDRS III scores. Subgroup analyses 
      suggest a more prominent effect for M1 stimulation. Meta-regression revealed that 
      a greater number of total stimulation pulses were associated with more UPDRS III 
      improvements over the long-term. CONCLUSION: The pooled evidence suggests that 
      rTMS improves upper limb function in the short-term, walking performance and 
      UPDRS III in the short- and long-terms in PD sufferers. Further studies are 
      required to develop optimal rTMS therapeutic protocols for PD.

AB  - Several Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) techniques can be applied to 
      noninvasively measure cortical excitability and brain plasticity in humans. TMS 
      has been used to assess neuroplastic changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      corroborating findings that cortical physiology is altered in AD due to the 
      underlying neurodegenerative process. In fact, many TMS studies have provided 
      physiological evidence of abnormalities in cortical excitability, connectivity, 
      and plasticity in patients with AD. Moreover, the combination of TMS with other 
      neurophysiological techniques, such as high-density electroencephalography (EEG), 
      makes it possible to study local and network cortical plasticity directly. 
      Interestingly, several TMS studies revealed abnormalities in patients with early 
      AD and even with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), thus enabling early 
      identification of subjects in whom the cholinergic degeneration has occurred. 
      Furthermore, TMS can influence brain function if delivered repetitively; 
      repetitive TMS (rTMS) is capable of modulating cortical excitability and inducing 
      long-lasting neuroplastic changes. Preliminary findings have suggested that rTMS 
      can enhance performances on several cognitive functions impaired in AD and MCI. 
      However, further well-controlled studies with appropriate methodology in larger 
      patient cohorts are needed to replicate and extend the initial findings. The 
      purpose of this paper was to provide an updated and comprehensive systematic 
      review of the studies that have employed TMS/rTMS in patients with MCI and AD.

TI  - Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on Parkinson motor 
      function: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.
PG  - 82-9
LID - 10.1017/neu.2014.43 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have demonstrated inconsistent findings regarding 
      the efficacy of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) 
      in treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, this 
      meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of low-frequency rTMS. 
      METHODS: A comprehensive literature search (including PubMed, CCTR, Embase, Web 
      of Science, CNKI, CBM-disc, NTIS,EAGLE, Clinical Trials, Current Controlled 
      Trials, International Clinical Trials Registry) was conducted dating until June 
      2014. The key search terms ('Parkinson', 'PD', 'transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation', 'TMS', 'RTMS' and 'noninvasive brain stimulation') produced eight 
      high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCT) of low-frequency rTMS versus sham 
      stimulation. RESULTS: These eight studies, composed of 319 patients, were 
      meta-analysed through assessment of the decreased Unified Parkinson's Disease 
      Rating Scale (UPDRS part III) score. Pooling of the results from these RCTs 
      yielded an effect size of -0.40 (95%CI=-0.73 to -0.06, p<0.05) in UPDRS part III, 
      which indicated that low-frequency rTMS could have 5.05 (95%CI=-1.73 to -8.37) 
      point decrease in UPDRS part III score than sham stimulation. DISCUSSION: 
      Low-frequency rTMS had a significant effect on motor signs in PD. As the number 
      of RCTs and PD patients included here was limited, further large-scale 
      multi-center RCTs were required to validate our conclusions.

      outlook 2015.
PG  - 11-24
LID - 10.3233/NRE-151237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), the emergence of 
      symptoms refractory to conventional therapy poses a therapeutic challenge. The 
      success of deep brain stimulation (DBS) and advances in the understanding of the 
      pathophysiology of PD have raised interest in non-invasive brain stimulation as 
      an alternative therapeutic tool. The rationale for its use draws from the concept 
      that reversing abnormalities in brain activity and physiology thought to cause 
      the clinical deficits may restore normal functioning. Currently the best evidence 
      in support of this concept comes from DBS, which improves motor deficits, and 
      modulates brain activity and motor cortex physiology, though whether a causal 
      interaction exists remains largely undetermined. CONCLUSION: Most trials of 
      non-invasive brain stimulation in PD have applied repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the primary motor cortex and cortical areas 
      of the motor circuit. Published studies suggest a possible therapeutic potential 
      of rTMS and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), but clinical effects 
      so far have been small and negligible regarding functional independence and 
      quality of life. Approaches to potentiate the efficacy of rTMS, including 
      increasing stimulation intensity and novel stimulation parameters, derive their 
      rationale from studies of brain physiology. These novel parameters simulate 
      normal firing patterns or act on the hypothesized role of oscillatory activity in 
      the motor cortex and basal ganglia in motor control. There may also be diagnostic 
      potential of TMS in characterizing individual traits for personalized medicine.

TI  - Hyperkinetic disorders and loss of synaptic downscaling.
PG  - 868-75
LID - 10.1038/nn.4306 [doi]
AB  - Recent clinical and preclinical studies have shown that hyperkinetic disorders 
      such as Huntington's disease, dystonia and l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in 
      Parkinson's disease are all characterized by loss of the ability to reverse 
      synaptic plasticity and an associated increase in the excitability of excitatory 
      neuronal inputs to a range of cortical and subcortical brain areas. Moreover, 
      these changes have been detected in humans with hyperkinetic disorders either via 
      direct recordings from implanted deep brain electrodes or noninvasively using 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation. Here we discuss the mechanisms underlying the 
      loss of bidirectional plasticity and the possibility that future interventions 
      could be devised to reverse these changes in patients with hyperkinetic movement 
      disorders.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by several neuropathological changes, 
      mainly extracellular amyloid aggregates (plaques), intraneuronal inclusions of 
      phosphorylated tau (tangles), as well as neuronal and synaptic degeneration, 
      accompanied by tissue reactions to these processes (astrocytosis and microglial 
      activation) that precede neuronal network disturbances in the symptomatic phase 
      of the disease. A number of biomarkers for these brain tissue changes have been 
      developed, mainly using immunoassays. In this review, we discuss how targeted 
      mass spectrometry (TMS) can be used to validate and further characterize classes 
      of biomarkers reflecting different AD pathologies, such as tau- and amyloid-beta 
      pathologies, synaptic dysfunction, lysosomal dysregulation, and axonal damage, 
      and the prospect of using TMS to measure these proteins in clinical research and 
      diagnosis. TMS advantages and disadvantages in relation to immunoassays are 
      discussed, and complementary aspects of the technologies are discussed.

AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogenous neurodegenerative disorder, 
      characterized by diverse clinical presentations, neuropathological 
      characteristics and underlying genetic causes. Emerging evidence has shown that 
      FTD is characterized by a series of changes in several neurotransmitter systems, 
      including serotonin, dopamine, GABA and, above all, glutamate. Indeed, several 
      studies have now provided preclinical and clinical evidence that glutamate is key 
      in the pathogenesis of FTD. Animal models of FTD have shown a selective 
      hypofunction in N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) and 
      α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, while in 
      patients, glutamatergic pyramidal neurons are depleted in several areas, 
      including the frontal and temporal cortices. Recently, a selective involvement of 
      the AMPA GluA3 subunit has been observed in patients with autoimmune anti-GluA3 
      antibodies, which accounted for nearly 25% of FTD patients, leading to a decrease 
      of the GluA3 subunit synaptic localization of the AMPA receptor and loss of 
      dendritic spines. Other in vivo evidence of the involvement of the glutamatergic 
      system in FTD derives from non-invasive brain stimulation studies using 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, in which specific stimulation protocols have 
      indirectly identified a selective and prominent impairment in glutamatergic 
      circuits in patients with both sporadic and genetic FTD. In view of limited 
      disease modifying therapies to slow or revert disease progression in FTD, an 
      important approach could consist in targeting the neurotransmitter deficits, 
      similarly to what has been achieved in Parkinson's disease with dopaminergic 
      therapy or Alzheimer's disease with cholinergic therapy. In this review, we 
      summarize the current evidence concerning the involvement of the glutamatergic 
      system in FTD, suggesting the development of new therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Neuromodulation in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: Current and Emerging 
      Approaches.
PG  - 1299-1313
LID - 10.3233/JAD-200913 [doi]
AB  - Neuromodulation as a treatment strategy for psychiatric and neurological diseases 
      has grown in popularity in recent years, with the approval of repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of depression being 
      one such example. These approaches offer new hope in the treatment of diseases 
      that have proven largely intractable to traditional pharmacological approaches. 
      For this reason, neuromodulation is increasingly being explored for the treatment 
      of Alzheimer's disease. However, such approaches have variable, and, in many 
      cases, very limited evidence for safety and efficacy, with most human evidence 
      obtained in small clinical trials. Here we review work in animal models and 
      humans with Alzheimer's disease exploring emerging neuromodulation modalities. 
      Approaches reviewed include deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, ultrasound stimulation, 
      photobiomodulation, and visual or auditory stimulation. In doing so, we clarify 
      the current evidence for these approaches in treating Alzheimer's disease and 
      identify specific areas where additional work is needed to facilitate their 
      clinical translation.

AB  - Electromagnetic therapy is a non-invasive and safe approach for the management of 
      several pathological conditions including neurodegenerative diseases. Parkinson's 
      disease is a neurodegenerative pathology caused by abnormal degeneration of 
      dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars 
      compacta in the midbrain resulting in damage to the basal ganglia. 
      Electromagnetic therapy has been extensively used in the clinical setting in the 
      form of transcranial magnetic stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation, high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation and pulsed 
      electromagnetic field therapy which can also be used in the domestic setting. In 
      this review, we discuss the mechanisms and therapeutic applications of 
      electromagnetic therapy to alleviate motor and non-motor deficits that 
      characterize Parkinson's disease.

AB  - The combination of pharmacology and transcranial magnetic stimulation to study 
      the effects of drugs on TMS-evoked EMG responses (pharmaco-TMS-EMG) has 
      considerably improved our understanding of the effects of TMS on the human brain. 
      Ten years have elapsed since an influential review on this topic has been 
      published in this journal (Ziemann, 2004). Since then, several major developments 
      have taken place: TMS has been combined with EEG to measure TMS evoked responses 
      directly from brain activity rather than by motor evoked potentials in a muscle, 
      and pharmacological characterization of the TMS-evoked EEG potentials, although 
      still in its infancy, has started (pharmaco-TMS-EEG). Furthermore, the knowledge 
      from pharmaco-TMS-EMG that has been primarily obtained in healthy subjects is now 
      applied to clinical settings, for instance, to monitor or even predict clinical 
      drug responses in neurological or psychiatric patients. Finally, pharmaco-TMS-EMG 
      has been applied to understand the effects of CNS active drugs on non-invasive 
      brain stimulation induced long-term potentiation-like and long-term 
      depression-like plasticity. This is a new field that may help to develop 
      rationales of pharmacological treatment for enhancement of recovery and 
      re-learning after CNS lesions. This up-dated review will highlight important 
      knowledge and recent advances in the contribution of pharmaco-TMS-EMG and 
      pharmaco-TMS-EEG to our understanding of normal and dysfunctional excitability, 
      connectivity and plasticity of the human brain.

AB  - Working memory (WM) is a cognitive process that involves maintaining and 
      manipulating information for a short period of time. WM is central to many 
      cognitive processes and declines rapidly with age. Deficits in WM are seen in 
      older adults and in patients with dementia, schizophrenia, major depression, mild 
      cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, etc. The frontal, parietal, and 
      occipital cortices are significantly involved in WM processing and all brain 
      oscillations are implicated in tackling WM tasks, particularly theta and gamma 
      bands. The theta/gamma neural code hypothesis assumes that retained memory items 
      are recorded via theta-nested gamma cycles. Neuronal oscillations can be 
      manipulated by sensory, invasive- and non-invasive brain stimulations. 
      Transcranial alternating-current stimulation (tACS) and repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are frequency-tuned non-invasive brain stimulation 
      (NIBS) techniques that have been used to entrain endogenous oscillations in a 
      frequency-specific manner. Compared to rTMS, tACS demonstrates superior cost, 
      tolerability, portability, and safety profile, making it an attractive potential 
      tool for improving cognitive performance. Although cognitive research with tACS 
      is still in its infancy compared to rTMS, a number of studies have shown a 
      promising WM enhancement effect, especially in the elderly and patients with 
      cognitive deficits. This review focuses on the various methods and outcomes of 
      tACS on WM in healthy and unhealthy human adults and highlights the established 
      findings, unknowns, challenges, and perspectives important for translating 
      laboratory tACS into realistic clinical settings. This will allow researchers to 
      identify gaps in the literature and develop frequency-tuned tACS protocols with 
      promising safety and efficacy outcomes. Therefore, research efforts in this 
      direction should help to consider frequency-tuned tACS as a non-pharmacological 
      tool of cognitive rehabilitation in physiological aging and patients with 
      cognitive deficits.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are a collection of disorders that result in the 
      progressive degeneration and death of neurons. They are clinically heterogenous 
      and can present as deficits in movement, cognition, executive function, memory, 
      visuospatial awareness and language. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a 
      non-invasive brain stimulation tool that allows for the assessment of cortical 
      function in vivo. We review how TMS has been used for the investigation of three 
      neurodegenerative diseases that differ in their neuroanatomical axes: (1) Motor 
      cortex-corticospinal tract (motor neuron diseases), (2) Non-motor cortical areas 
      (dementias), and (3) Subcortical structures (parkinsonisms). We also make four 
      recommendations that we hope will benefit the use of TMS in neurodegenerative 
      diseases. Firstly, TMS has traditionally been limited by the lack of an objective 
      output and so has been confined to stimulation of the motor cortex; this 
      limitation can be overcome by the use of concurrent neuroimaging methods such as 
      EEG. Given that neurodegenerative diseases progress over time, TMS measures 
      should aim to track longitudinal changes, especially when the aim of the study is 
      to look at disease progression and symptomatology. The lack of gold-standard 
      diagnostic confirmation undermines the validity of findings in clinical 
      populations. Consequently, diagnostic certainty should be maximized through a 
      variety of methods including multiple, independent clinical assessments, imaging 
      and fluids biomarkers, and post-mortem pathological confirmation where possible. 
      There is great interest in understanding the mechanisms by which symptoms arise 
      in neurodegenerative disorders. However, TMS assessments in patients are usually 
      carried out during resting conditions, when the brain network engaged during 
      these symptoms is not expressed. Rather, a context-appropriate form of TMS would 
      be more suitable in probing the physiology driving clinical symptoms. In all, we 
      hope that the recommendations made here will help to further understand the 
      pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.

LID - 984708
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been 
      extensively studied in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the clinical 
      evidence remains inconsistent. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate 
      the effects of rTMS on global cognitive function in patients with AD. METHODS: An 
      integrated literature search using 4 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, 
      and Cochrane Library) was performed to identify English language articles 
      published up to October 6, 2021. We pooled Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 
      and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores 
      using a random-effects model via RevMan 5.4 software. We calculated estimates of 
      mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary outcomes 
      were pre-post treatment changes in global cognition as measured using MMSE and 
      ADAS-Cog immediately after rTMS treatment, and the secondary outcome was duration 
      of cognitive improvement (1-1.5 and ≥3 months). RESULTS: Nine studies with 361 
      patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that rTMS 
      significantly improved global cognitive function immediately following rTMS 
      treatment [(MD) 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41-2.22, p < 0.00001, MMSE; 
      2.72, 95% CI, 1.77-3.67, p < 0.00001, ADAS-Cog], and the therapeutic effects 
      persisted for an extended duration (2.20, 95% CI, 0.93-3.47, p =0.0007, MMSE; 
      1.96, 95% CI, 0.96-2.95, p = 0.0001, ADAS-Cog). Subgroup analyses showed that 
      high frequency rTMS targeted to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
      for over 20 sessions induced the greatest cognitive improvement, with effects 
      lasting for more than 1 month after the final treatment. There were no 
      significant differences in dropout rate (p > 0.05) or adverse effect rate (p > 
      0.05) between the rTMS and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive TMS is a 
      potentially effective treatment for cognitive impairment in AD that is safe and 
      can induce long-lasting effects. Our results also showed that ADAS-cog and MMSE 
      differed in determination of global cognitive impairment. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

LID - 10.4103/0366-6999.229889 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is one of the most common sleep 
      abnormalities in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), yet its multifactorial 
      etiology complicates its treatment. This review summarized recent studies on the 
      epidemiology, etiology, clinical implications, associated features, and 
      evaluation of EDS in PD. The efficacy of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic 
      treatments for EDS in PD was also reviewed. DATA SOURCES: English language 
      articles indexed in PubMed and Cochrane databases and Chinese-language papers 
      indexed in Wanfang and National Knowledge Infrastructure databases that were 
      published between January 1987 and November 2017 were located using the following 
      search terms: "sleepiness", "sleep and Parkinson's disease", and "Parkinson's 
      disease and treatment". STUDY SELECTION: Original research articles and critical 
      reviews related to EDS in PD were selected. RESULTS: EDS is a major health hazard 
      and is associated with many motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD. Its causes are 
      multifactorial. There are few specific guidelines for the treatment of EDS in PD. 
      It is first necessary to identify and treat any possible factors causing EDS. 
      Recent studies showed that some nonpharmacologic (i.e., cognitive behavioral 
      therapy, light therapy, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) and 
      pharmacologic (i.e., modafinil, methylphenidate, caffeine, istradefylline, sodium 
      oxybate, and atomoxetine) treatments may be effective in treating EDS in PD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: EDS is common in the PD population and can have an immensely 
      negative impact on quality of life. Its causes are multifactorial, which 
      complicates its treatment. Further investigations are required to determine the 
      safety and efficacy of potential therapies and to develop novel treatment 
      approaches for EDS in PD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary movement disorder with dementia and 
      behavioral difficulties caused by a mutation in the HTT gene. Age-at-onset, 
      clinical phenotype and disease evolution vary and are not explained by the 
      mutation alone. Electrophysiological techniques, like transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation and electroencephalography, have advanced our understanding of the 
      pathophysiology but have not revealed any consistent abnormalities suitable as 
      biomarkers. The most promising candidate may be somatosensory or visual evoked 
      potentials, which repeatedly had reduced amplitudes in manifest HD. To test their 
      potential, large cohorts of clinically homogeneous patients need to be studied 
      with electrophysiological in conjunction with neuroimaging techniques to 
      delineate neural network function in relation to micro- and macro-structural 
      brain changes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) and its preclinical stage, mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI), are critical issues confronting the aging society. 
      Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have the potential to be 
      effective tools for enhancing cognitive functioning. The main objective of our 
      meta-analysis was to quantify and update the status of the efficacy of repetitive 
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Transcranial Direct Current 
      Stimulation (tDCS) when applied in AD and MCI. METHODS: The systematic literature 
      search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science according to PRISMA statement. 
      RESULTS: Pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) from 32 studies were analyzed using 
      random effect models. We found both, rTMS and tDCS to have significant immediate 
      cognition-enhancing effect in AD with rTMS inducing also beneficial long-term 
      effects. We found no evidence for synergistic effect of cognitive training with 
      NIBS. CONCLUSIONS: In AD a clinical recommendation can be made for NEURO-AD(TM) 
      system and for high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      (DLPFC) as probably effective protocols (B-level of evidence) and for anodal tDCS 
      over the left DLPFC as a possibly effective. SIGNIFICANCE: According to 
      scientific literature, NIBS may be an effective method for improving cognition in 
      AD and possibly in MCI.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation in Alzheimer's disease: a neurophysiological 
      marker of cortical hyperexcitability.
PG  - 587-98
LID - 10.1007/s00702-010-0554-9 [doi]
AB  - Recently, neuropathological studies have shown an important motor cortex 
      involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD), even in its early stages, despite the 
      lack of clinically evident motor deficit. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
      studies have demonstrated that cortical excitability is enhanced in AD patients. 
      This cortical hyperexcitability is believed to be a compensatory mechanism to 
      execute voluntary movements, despite the progressive impairment of associative 
      cortical areas. At present, it is not clear if these motor cortex excitability 
      changes might be the expression of an involvement of intracortical excitatory 
      glutamatergic circuits or an impairment of inhibitory cholinergic and, to a 
      lesser extent, gabaergic activity. Although the main hypothesis for the 
      pathogenesis of AD remains the degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic 
      neurons, the development of specific TMS protocols, such as the paired-pulse TMS 
      and the study of the short-latency afferent inhibition, points out the role of 
      other neurotransmitters, such as gamma-amino-butyric acid, glutamate and 
      dopamine. The potential therapeutic effect of repetitive TMS in restoring or 
      compensating damaged cognitive functions, might become a possible rehabilitation 
      tool in AD patients. Based on different patterns of cortical excitability, TMS 
      may be useful in discriminating between physiological brain aging, mild cognitive 
      impairment, AD and other dementing disorders. The present review provides a 
      perspective of these TMS techniques by further understanding the role of 
      different neurotransmission pathways and plastic remodelling of neuronal networks 
      in the pathogenesis of AD.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS) are promising noninvasive cortical stimulation methods 
      for adjunctive treatment of movement disorders. They avoid surgical risks and 
      provide theoretical advantages of specific neural circuit neuromodulation. 
      Neuromodulatory effects depend on extrinsic stimulation factors (cortical target, 
      frequency, intensity, duration, number of sessions), intrinsic patient factors 
      (disease process, individual variability and symptoms, state of medication 
      treatment), and outcome measures. Most studies to date have shown beneficial 
      effects of rTMS or tDCS on clinical symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and 
      support the notion of spatial specificity to the effects on motor and nonmotor 
      symptoms. Stimulation parameters have varied widely, however, and some studies 
      are poorly controlled. Studies of rTMS or tDCS in dystonia have provided abundant 
      data on physiology, but few on clinical effects. Multiple mechanisms likely 
      contribute to the clinical effects of rTMS and tDCS in movement disorders, 
      including normalization of cortical excitability, rebalancing of distributed 
      neural network activity, and induction of dopamine release. It remains unclear 
      how to individually adjust rTMS or tDCS factors for the most beneficial effects 
      on symptoms of PD or dystonia. Nonetheless, the noninvasive nature, minimal side 
      effects, positive effects in preliminary clinical studies, and increasing 
      evidence for rational mechanisms make rTMS and tDCS attractive for ongoing 
      investigation.

AB  - While motor cortical areas are the main targets of the integrative activity of 
      basal ganglia, their main output consists of the corticospinal system. 
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a relatively new method to investigate 
      corticospinal physiology, has been widely used to assess possible changes 
      secondary to Parkinson's disease (PD). The use of single- and paired-pulse TMS, 
      two varieties of the original technique, disclosed multiple functional 
      alterations of the corticospinal pathway. For instance, when the latter was 
      tested at 'rest', or in response to somesthetic afferents, it showed excess 
      excitability or reduced inhibition. In turn, during production of a voluntary 
      output, its activation was defective, or inadequately modulated. One major 
      mechanism may be a dysfunction of the interneurons mediating the level of 
      excitation within cortical area 4. For instance, there is a shortening of the 
      so-termed 'central silent period', which is a complex, TMS-induced, inhibitory 
      phenomenon possibly mediated by activation of GABA(B) receptors. The so-called 
      'short-interval intracortical inhibition', which is possibly mediated by GABA(A) 
      receptors, is also diminished. Levodopa restores these and other TMS alterations, 
      thus demonstrating that cortical area 4 is sensitive to dopamine modulation. 
      Overall, TMS has provided substantial new pathophysiological insights, which 
      point to a central role of the primary motor cortex in the movement disorder 
      typical of PD. Repetitive (r-)TMS, another form of TMS, has been studied as a 
      treatment for PD motor signs. Although some reports are favorable, others are 
      not, and have raised the problem of appropriate control experiments. Although 
      extremely interesting, the potential therapeutic role of r-TMS in PD needs 
      further evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative 
      disorder worldwide. The symptoms of PD are characterized not only by motor 
      alterations but also by a spectrum of nonmotor symptoms. Some of these are 
      psychiatric manifestations such as sleep disorders; depression; cognitive 
      difficulties that can evolve into dementia; and symptoms of psychosis, which 
      include hallucinations, illusions, and delusions. Parkinson's disease psychosis 
      (PDP) occurs in 18-50% of patients with PD. Treating PDP is challenging because 
      antipsychotic drugs tend to be inefficient or may even worsen the disease's motor 
      symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to summarize the current understanding of 
      the molecular mechanisms involved in PDP and recent innovative alternatives for 
      its treatment. METHODS: This is a narrative review in which an extensive 
      literature search was performed on the Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed, ISI Web of 
      Science, and Google Scholar databases from inception to August 2021. The terms 
      "Parkinson's disease psychosis", "Parkinson psychosis," "neurodegenerative 
      psychosis", and "dopamine psychosis" were among the keywords used in the search. 
      RESULTS: Recently, views on the etiology of hallucinations and illusions have 
      evolved remarkably. PDP has been cemented as a multifactorial entity dependent on 
      extrinsic and novel intrinsic mechanisms, including genetic factors, 
      neurostructural alterations, functional disruptions, visual processing 
      disturbances, and sleep disorders. Consequently, innovative pharmacological and 
      biological treatments have been proposed. Pimavanserin, a selective 5-HT2A 
      inverse agonist, stands out after its approval to treat PDP-associated 
      hallucinations and illusions. CONCLUSION: Future results from upcoming clinical 
      trials should further characterize the role of this drug in the management of PDP 
      as well as other treatment options with novel mechanisms of action, such as 
      saracatinib, SEP-363856, cannabidiol, electroconvulsive therapy, and transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation.

TI  - Effects of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation on Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 410-424
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.40 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous meta-analyses did not explore the immediate and long-term 
      effect of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on different cognitive domains in 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). The meta-analysis aimed to assess the therapy effect of 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS) on different cognitive domains in AD in randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Studies published before December 2021 and 
      exploring therapy effect of rTMS, tDCS on different cognitive domains in AD were 
      searched in the following databases: PubMed and Web of Science. We used STATA 
      12.0 software to compute the standard mean difference (SMD) and a 95% confidence 
      interval (CI). RESULTS: The present study included 16 articles (including 372 AD 
      patients treated with rTMS and 310 treated with sham rTMS) for rTMS and 11 
      articles (including 152 AD patients treated with tDCS and 134 treated with sham 
      tDCS) for tDCS. The present study showed better immediate and long-term general 
      cognitive function increase effects in AD given rTMS, compared to those given 
      sham rTMS with random effects models (immediate effect: SMD = 2.07, 95% CI = 0.37 
      to 3.77, I2 = 97.8%, p < 0.001; long-term effect: SMD = 5.04, 95% CI = 2.25 to 
      7.84, I2 = 97.8%, p < 0.001). The present study showed no significant immediate 
      and long-term effects of rTMS on attention, executive, language and memory 
      functions. In addition, the present study showed no significant difference in 
      immediate or long-term effects of tDCS on general cognitive function, attention, 
      language or memory functions between tDCS group and sham tDCS group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      RTMS was an effective treatment technique for general cognitive function in AD, 
      whereas tDCS showed no significant therapy effect on cognitive function in AD. 
      More large-scale studies were essential to explore the effect of NIBS on various 
      cognitive function in AD.

AB  - Decrease in cognitive function is one of the most common causes of poor life 
      quality and early disability in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Existing 
      methods of treatment are aimed at both correction of motor and non-motor 
      symptoms. Methods of adjuvant therapy (or complementary therapy) for maintaining 
      cognitive functions in patients with PD are of interest. A promising subject of 
      research in this regard is the method of transcranial electric current 
      stimulation (tES). Here we reviewed the current understanding of the pathogenesis 
      of cognitive impairment in PD and of the effects of transcranial direct current 
      stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimulation on the cognitive 
      function of patients with PD-MCI (Parkinson's Disease-Mild Cognitive Impairment).

TI  - Corticobasal syndrome: neuroimaging and neurophysiological advances.
PG  - 701-e52
LID - 10.1111/ene.13928 [doi]
AB  - Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by 
      4R tau protein deposition in several brain regions that clinically manifests 
      itself as a heterogeneous atypical parkinsonism typically expressed in adulthood. 
      The prototypical clinical phenotype of CBD is corticobasal syndrome (CBS). 
      Important insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying motor and 
      higher cortical symptoms in CBS have been gained by using advanced neuroimaging 
      and neurophysiological techniques. Structural and functional neuroimaging studies 
      often show asymmetric cortical and subcortical abnormalities, mainly involving 
      perirolandic and parietal regions and basal ganglia structures. 
      Neurophysiological investigations including electroencephalography and 
      somatosensory evoked potentials provide useful information on the origin of 
      myoclonus and on cortical sensory loss. Transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      demonstrates heterogeneous and asymmetric changes in the excitability and 
      plasticity of primary motor cortex and abnormal hemispheric connectivity. 
      Neuroimaging and neurophysiological abnormalities in multiple brain areas reflect 
      asymmetric neurodegeneration, leading to asymmetric motor and higher cortical 
      symptoms in CBS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to analyze the efficacy and safety of TMS on cognition in mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), AD-related dementias, and 
      nondementia conditions with comorbid cognitive impairment. DESIGN: Systematic 
      review, Meta-Analysis. SETTING: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane database, 
      APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus from January 1, 2000, to February 9, 
      2023. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: RCTs, open-label, and case series studies 
      reporting cognitive outcomes following TMS intervention were included. 
      MEASUREMENT: Cognitive and safety outcomes were measured. Cochrane Risk of Bias 
      for RCTs and MINORS (Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies) criteria 
      were used to evaluate study quality. This study was registered with PROSPERO 
      (CRD42022326423). RESULTS: The systematic review included 143 studies (n = 5,800 
      participants) worldwide, encompassing 94 RCTs, 43 open-label prospective, 3 
      open-label retrospective, and 3 case series. The meta-analysis included 25 RCTs 
      in MCI and AD. Collectively, these studies provide evidence of improved global 
      and specific cognitive measures with TMS across diagnostic groups. Only 2 studies 
      (among 143) reported 4 adverse events of seizures: 3 were deemed TMS unrelated 
      and another resolved with coil repositioning. Meta-analysis showed large effect 
      sizes on global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination (SMD = 0.80 [0.26, 
      1.33], p = 0.003), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (SMD = 0.85 [0.26, 1.44], p = 
      0.005), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (SMD = -0.96 
      [-1.32, -0.60], p < 0.001)) in MCI and AD, although with significant 
      heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The reviewed studies provide favorable evidence of 
      improved cognition with TMS across all groups with cognitive impairment. TMS was 
      safe and well tolerated with infrequent serious adverse events.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may offer a reliable means of 
      characterizing important pathophysiologic aspects of motor impairments in 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, high-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS), 
      especially if delivered bilaterally over motor cortical regions, can have 
      beneficial effects on parkinsonian motor symptoms. However, only a few studies 
      have investigated the effects of rTMS on freezing of gait (FOG) and other gait 
      disturbances in PD. We aimed at investigating in this narrative review the 
      usefulness of TMS for exploring the pathophysiology of gait impairment and at 
      evaluating the therapeutic effects of rTMS in this context. The combination of 
      rTMS and treadmill training was found to enhance the effect of physical therapy. 
      Use of an H-coil enables stimulation of deep regions of the brain (for example 
      medial prefrontal cortex) and may be used as a target for add-on therapy in the 
      future. In contrast, theta burst stimulation has proven to be ineffective in 
      treating gait disturbances in PD patients. Dual-mode NIBS, in particular 
      preconditioning motor cortex rTMS by transcranial direct current stimulation, 
      might also represent a novel therapeutic approach for patients with gait 
      disturbances. Recent studies suggest that the supplementary motor area could be 
      an appropriate target for brain stimulation when treating PD patients with FOG. 
      Further large sample and well-designed clinical studies are required to evaluate 
      how the possible positive effects of rTMS can be sustained over time and to 
      determine the optimal stimulation protocols including target, stimulation 
      intensity/duration and number of sessions.

AB  - As we age, sleep patterns undergo severe modifications of their micro and 
      macrostructure, with an overall lighter and more fragmented sleep structure. In 
      general, interventions targeting sleep represent an excellent opportunity not 
      only to maintain life quality in the healthy aging population, but also to 
      enhance cognitive performance and, when pathology arises, to potentially 
      prevent/slow down conversion from e.g. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to 
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Sleep abnormalities are, in fact, one of the earliest 
      recognizable biomarkers of dementia, being also partially responsible for a 
      cascade of cortical events that worsen dementia pathophysiology, including 
      impaired clearance systems leading to build-up of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) 
      peptide and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. In this context, 
      Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NiBS) techniques, such as transcranial electrical 
      stimulation (tES) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), may help 
      investigate the neural substrates of sleep, identify sleep-related pathology 
      biomarkers, and ultimately help patients and healthy elderly individuals to 
      restore sleep quality and cognitive performance. However, brain stimulation 
      applications during sleep have so far not been fully investigated in healthy 
      elderly cohorts, nor tested in AD patients or other related dementias. The 
      manuscript discusses the role of sleep in normal and pathological aging, 
      reviewing available evidence of NiBS applications during both wakefulness and 
      sleep in healthy elderly individuals as well as in MCI/AD patients. Rationale and 
      details for potential future brain stimulation studies targeting sleep 
      alterations in the aging brain are discussed, including enhancement of cognitive 
      performance, overall quality of life as well as protein clearance.

AB  - Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques can significantly modulate 
      cognitive functions in healthy subjects and patients with neuropsychiatric 
      disorders. Recently, they have been applied in patients with mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) to prevent or delay 
      the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we review this emerging 
      empirical corpus and discuss therapeutic effects of NIBS on several target 
      functions (e.g., memory for face-name associations and non-verbal recognition, 
      attention, psychomotor speed, everyday memory). Available studies have yielded 
      mixed results, possibly due to differences among their tasks, designs, and 
      samples, let alone the latter's small sizes. Thus, the impact of NIBS on 
      cognitive performance in MCI and SCI remains to be determined. To foster progress 
      in this direction, we outline methodological approaches that could improve the 
      efficacy and specificity of NIBS in both conditions. Furthermore, we discuss the 
      need for multicenter studies, accurate diagnosis, and longitudinal approaches 
      combining NIBS with specific training regimes. These tenets could cement 
      biomedical developments supporting new treatments for MCI and preventive 
      therapies for AD.

AB  - Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a debilitating disorder characterized by the 
      gradual loss of language functioning resulting from neurodegenerative diseases 
      including frontotemporal lobar degeneration or Alzheimer's disease pathology. 
      There is a dearth of research investigating language therapy in PPA. Unlike 
      individuals with poststroke aphasia, language skills are expected to decline over 
      time, so the goal of treatment is often to preserve existing language 
      functioning. There has been an increasing interest in using non-invasive brain 
      stimulation including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial 
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) to augment traditional behavioral therapy in 
      PPA. Research is promising and suggests neuromodulation can lead to 
      generalization and maintenance of treatment effects for a longer period compared 
      to behavioral therapy alone. Emerging research is also beginning to identify 
      predictors of treatment response. Yet there is still much to learn regarding how 
      neuromodulation factors (e.g., type of stimulation, stimulation intensity), 
      participant factors (e.g., demographics, extent and location of atrophy), and 
      treatment factors (e.g., type of language therapy, and dosage) will interact to 
      predict treatment response. We are moving toward a promising future where 
      individuals with PPA will benefit from individualized therapy protocols pairing 
      traditional language therapy with neuromodulation.

AB  - Levodopa therapy remains the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson's 
      disease, and it is associated with the greatest improvement in motor function as 
      assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Dopamine agonists have 
      also proven their efficacy as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease but also 
      as adjunct therapy. However, the chronic use of dopaminergic therapy is 
      associated with disabling motor and nonmotor side effects and complications, 
      among which levodopa-induced dyskinesias and impulse control behaviors are the 
      most common. The underlying mechanisms of these disorders are not fully 
      understood. In the last decade, classic neuroimaging methods and more 
      sophisticated techniques, such as analysis of gray-matter structural imaging and 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging, have given access to anatomical and 
      functional abnormalities, respectively, in the brain. This review presents an 
      overview of structural and functional brain changes associated with motor and 
      nonmotor therapy-induced complications in Parkinson's disease. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging may offer structural and/or functional neuroimaging biomarkers that could 
      be used as predictive signs of development, maintenance, and progression of these 
      complications. Neurophysiological tools, such as theta burst stimulation and 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, might help us to integrate neuroimaging 
      findings and clinical features and could be used as therapeutic options, 
      translating neuroimaging data into clinical practice. © 2020 International

AB  - Movement abnormalities of Parkinson's disease (PD) arise from disordered neural 
      activity in multiple interconnected brain structures. The planning and execution 
      of movement requires recruitment of a heterogeneous collection of pyramidal 
      projection neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1). The neural representations 
      of movement in M1 single-cell and field potential recordings are directly and 
      indirectly influenced by the midbrain dopaminergic neurons that degenerate in PD. 
      This review examines M1 functional alterations in PD as uncovered by 
      electrophysiological recordings and neurostimulation studies in patients and 
      experimental animal models. Dysfunction of the parkinsonian M1 depends on the 
      severity and/or duration of dopamine-depletion and the species examined, and is 
      expressed as alterations in movement-related firing dynamics; functional 
      reorganisation of local circuits; and changes in field potential beta 
      oscillations. Neurostimulation methods that modulate M1 activity directly (e.g., 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation) or indirectly (subthalamic nucleus deep brain 
      stimulation) improve motor function in PD patients, showing that targeted 
      neuromodulation of M1 is a realistic therapy. We argue that the therapeutic 
      profile of M1 neurostimulation is likely to be greatly enhanced with alternative 
      technologies that permit cell-type specific control and incorporate feedback from 
      electrophysiological biomarkers measured locally.

TI  - Alzheimer's disease with frailty: Prevalence, screening, assessment, intervention 
      strategies and challenges.
PG  - 283-292
LID - 10.5582/bst.2023.01211 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions 
      worldwide and is expected to surge in prevalence due to aging populations. 
      Frailty, characterized by muscle function decline, becomes more prevalent with 
      age, imposing substantial burdens on patients and caregivers. This paper aimed to 
      comprehensively review the current literature on AD coupled with frailty, 
      encompassing prevalence, screening, assessment, and treatment while delving into 
      the field's challenges and future trajectories. Frailty and AD coexist in more 
      than 30% of cases, with hazard ratios above 120% indicating a mutually 
      detrimental association.Various screening tools have emerged for both frailty and 
      AD, including the Fried Frailty Phenotype (FP), FRAIL scale, Edmonton Frailty 
      Scale (EFS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
      (MoCA), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), and General Practitioner Assessment of 
      Cognition (GPCOG). However, none has solidified its role as the definitive gold 
      standard. The convergence of electronic health records and brain aging biomarkers 
      heralds a new era in AD with frailty screening and assessment. In terms of 
      intervention, non-pharmacological strategies spanning nutrition, horticulture, 
      exercise, and social interaction, along with pharmacological approaches involving 
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 
      antagonists, and anti-amyloid beta-protein medications, constituted cornerstones 
      for treating AD coupled with frailty. Technological interventions like repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) also entered the fold. Notably, 
      multi-domain non-pharmacological interventions wield considerable potential in 
      enhancing cognition and mitigating disability. However, the long-term efficacy 
      and safety of pharmacological interventions necessitate further validation. 
      Diagnosing and managing AD with frailty present several daunting challenges, 
      encompassing low rates of early co-diagnosis, limited clinical trial evidence, 
      and scarce integrated, pioneering service delivery models. These challenges 
      demand heightened attention through robust research and pragmatic implementation.

TI  - Depression in dementia with Lewy bodies: a critical update.
PG  - 1207-1218
LID - 10.1007/s00702-023-02669-8 [doi]
AB  - Depression with an estimated prevalence of 35% is a frequent manifestation of 
      dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), having negative effects on cognitive performance 
      and life expectancy, yet the underlying neurobiology is poorly understood and 
      most likely heterogeneous. Depressive symptoms in DLB can occur during the 
      clinical course and, together with apathy, is a common prodromal neuropsychiatric 
      symptom of this neurocognitive disorder in the group of Lewy body 
      synucleinopathies. There are no essential differences in the frequency of 
      depression in DLB and Parkinson disease-dementia (PDD), while its severity is up 
      to twice as high as in Alzheimer disease (AD). Depression in DLB that is 
      frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated, has been related to a variety of 
      pathogenic mechanisms associated with the basic neurodegenerative process, in 
      particular dysfunctions of neurotransmitter systems (decreased 
      monoaminergic/serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic metabolism), 
      α-synuclein pathology, synaptic zinc dysregulation, proteasome inhibition, gray 
      matter volume loss in prefrontal and temporal areas as well as dysfunction of 
      neuronal circuits with decreased functional connectivity of specific brain 
      networks. Pharmacotherapy should avoid tricyclic antidepressants (anticholinergic 
      adverse effects), second-generation antidepressants being a better choice, while 
      modified electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy and 
      deep brain stimulation may be effective for pharmacotherapy-resistant cases. 
      Since compared to depression in other dementias like Alzheimer disease and other 
      parkinsonian syndromes, our knowledge of its molecular basis is limited, and 
      further studies to elucidate the heterogeneous pathogenesis of depression in DLB 
      are warranted.

TI  - Basic principle of transcranial magnetic stimulation.
PG  - 1560-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a new neurophysiological 
      technique based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. When a pulse of 
      current passes through a coil, it becomes a magnetic field and penetrates the 
      scalp and skull, and reach the brain painlessly. OBJECTIVE: Review TMS 
      stimulator, types of stimulation, mechanism of action, and its application. 
      MATERIAL AND METHOD: There are three types of TMS stimulation: 1) Single pulse; 
      used in studying of motor threshold and phosphene threshold. 2) Paired pulse; 
      used in the study of intracortical inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms. 3) 
      Repetitive stimulation; changes corticospinal/corticocortical pathway. RESULTS: 
      The mechanisms increases activity of synapse, changes the secretion of 
      neurotransmitter and causes neuronal plasticity or long-term potentiation. 
      Repetitive stimulation is used in fundamental basic science for brain mapping. It 
      is a new therapeutic method for neuro-psychiatic disorders that does not respond 
      to medications. CONCLUSION: TMS study is rapidly increasing and accepted as a 
      noninvasive technique. The most favorable treating outcomes are depression and 
      Parkinson disease. Other neuro-psychiatic therapeutic outcomes are ongoing.

AB  - Impaired locomotion is a frequent and major source of disability in patients with 
      neurological conditions. Different neuroimaging methods have been used to 
      understand the brain substrates of locomotion in various neurological diseases 
      (mainly in Parkinson's disease) during actual walking, and while resting (using 
      mental imagery of gait, or brain-behavior correlation analyses). These studies, 
      using structural (i.e., MRI) or functional (i.e., functional MRI or functional 
      near infra-red spectroscopy) brain imaging, electrophysiology (i.e., EEG), 
      non-invasive brain stimulation (i.e., transcranial magnetic stimulation, or 
      transcranial direct current stimulation) or molecular imaging methods (i.e., PET, 
      or SPECT) reveal extended brain networks involving both grey and white matters in 
      key cortical (i.e., prefrontal cortex) and subcortical (basal ganglia and 
      cerebellum) regions associated with locomotion. However, the specific roles of 
      the various pathophysiological mechanisms encountered in each neurological 
      condition on the phenotype of gait disorders still remains unclear. After 
      reviewing the results of individual brain imaging techniques across the common 
      neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia, stroke, or 
      multiple sclerosis, we will discuss how the development of new imaging techniques 
      and computational analyses that integrate multivariate correlations in "large 
      enough datasets" might help to understand how individual pathophysiological 
      mechanisms express clinically as an abnormal gait. Finally, we will explore how 
      these new analytic methods could drive our rehabilitative strategies.

AB  - Non-Alzheimer's dementia (NAD) accounts for 30% of all neurodegenerative 
      conditions and is characterized by cognitive decline beyond mere memory 
      dysfunction. Diagnosing NAD remains challenging due to the lack of established 
      biomarkers. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive 
      neurophysiological tool that enables the investigation of cortical excitability 
      in the human brain. Paired-pulse TMS paradigms include short- and long-interval 
      intracortical inhibition (SICI/LICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and 
      short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which can assess neurophysiological 
      functions of GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic neural circuits, 
      respectively. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to 
      compare these TMS indices among patients with NAD and healthy controls. Our 
      meta-analyses indicated that TMS neurophysiological examinations revealed 
      decreased glutamatergic function in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 
      and decreased GABAergic function in patients with FTD, progressive supranuclear 
      palsy, Huntington's disease, cortico-basal syndrome, and multiple system 
      atrophy-parkinsonian type. In addition, decreased cholinergic function was found 
      in dementia with Lewy body and vascular dementia. These results suggest the 
      potential of TMS as an additional diagnostic tool to differentiate NAD.

TI  - Cognitive Impairment and Celiac Disease: Is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation a 
      Trait d'Union between Gut and Brain?
LID - 10.3390/ijms19082243 [doi]
LID - 2243
AB  - Celiac disease is a systemic disorder with multifactorial pathogenesis and 
      multifaceted symptomatology. In response to gluten exposure, a significant part 
      of the general population produces antibodies that have been hypothesized to be 
      deleterious to the brain. Among the well-known neurological manifestations, adult 
      celiac patients often complain cognitive symptoms, ranging from the so-called 
      "brain fog" till an overt dementia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a 
      non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can contribute to the assessment 
      and monitoring of celiac patients, even in those without a clear neurological 
      involvement. The studies here reviewed seem to converge on an impaired central 
      motor conductivity and a "hyperexcitable celiac brain" to TMS, which partially 
      reverts back after a long-term gluten restriction. Notably, a clear 
      hyperexcitability is a stably reported feature of both degenerative and vascular 
      dementia. Therefore, given its potential neuroprotective effect, the gluten-free 
      diet should be introduced as early as possible, although the overall response of 
      neurological symptoms (and cognition in particular) is still controversial. 
      Identifying new and possibly modifiable risk factors may be of crucial importance 
      for patients, clinicians, and researchers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used in both 
      physiological studies and, more recently, the therapy of Parkinson's disease 
      (PD). Prior TMS studies in healthy subjects and other patient populations 
      demonstrate a slight risk of seizures and other adverse events. Our goal was to 
      estimate these risks and document other safety concerns specific to PD patients. 
      METHODS: We performed an English-Language literature search through PudMed to 
      review all TMS studies involving PD patients. We documented any seizures or other 
      adverse events associated with these studies. Crude risks were calculated per 
      subject and per session of TMS. RESULTS: We identified 84 single pulse (spTMS) 
      and/or paired-pulse (ppTMS) TMS studies involving 1091 patients and 77 repetitive 
      TMS (rTMS) studies involving 1137 patients. Risk of adverse events was low in all 
      protocols. spTMS and ppTMS risk per patient for any adverse event was 0.0018 (95% 
      CI: 0.0002-0.0066) per patient and no seizures were encountered. Risk of an 
      adverse event from rTMS was 0.040 (95% CI: 0.029-0.053) per patient and no 
      seizures were reported. Other adverse events included transient headaches, scalp 
      pain, tinnitus, nausea, increase in pre-existing pain, and muscle jerks. 
      Transient worsening of Parkinsonian symptoms was noted in one study involving 
      rTMS of the supplementary motor area (SMA). CONCLUSION: We conclude that current 
      TMS and rTMS protocols do not pose significant risks to PD patients. We would 
      recommend that TMS users in this population follow the most recent safety 
      guidelines but do not warrant additional precautions.

AB  - Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) is a new non-invasive 
      neuromodulation technique based on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      tech-nology. The new H-coil has significant advantages in the treatment and 
      mechanism research of psychiatric and neurological disorders. This is due to its 
      deep stimulation site and wide range of action. This paper reviews the clinical 
      progress of DTMS in psychiatric and neurological disorders such as Parkinson's 
      disease, Alzheimer's disease, post-stroke motor dysfunction, aphasia, and other 
      neurological disorders, as well as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.

AB  - Fatigue is one of the most common non-motor complaints of Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) patients and is associated with reduced activity and poorer quality of life. 
      Fatigue can be experienced as a state of being tired or weary (subjective 
      fatigue) or as a process of becoming tired or fatigued (fatigability). Subjective 
      mental and physical fatigue are evaluated using self-report questionnaires such 
      as the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory. Physical fatigability is studied in a 
      laboratory setting using physical exercise protocols and transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation. Mental fatigability is evaluated by measuring attention over time 
      using a reaction-time paradigm called the Attention Network Test (ANT). PD 
      patients report more subjective physical and mental fatigue than controls on a 
      variety of fatigue questionnaires. PD patients have increased physical 
      fatigability in force generation and finger tapping. Levodopa and modafinil 
      improve physical fatigability in PD subjects. Methylphenidate is useful for 
      treating subjective physical fatigue. PD subjects have greater mental 
      fatigability than control subjects and display abnormal performance in all three 
      attention networks in the ANT. Therapies targeting the neurotransmitter systems 
      involved in attention may be helpful for treating mental fatigability. Future 
      fatigue research should focus on developing gold standards for fatigue 
      measurement and developing treatments for fatigue and fatigability in PD.

TI  - Dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease: mechanisms and current non-pharmacological 
      interventions.
PG  - 472-89
LID - 10.1111/jnc.12751 [doi]
AB  - Dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease is associated with several 
      unwanted effects, of which dyskinesia is the most disabling. The development of 
      new therapeutic interventions to reduce the impact of dyskinesia in Parkinson's 
      disease is therefore a priority need. This review summarizes the key molecular 
      mechanisms that underlie dyskinesia. The role of dopamine receptors and their 
      associated signaling mechanisms including dopamine-cAMP-regulated neuronal 
      phosphoprotein, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, mammalian target of 
      rapamycin, mitogen and stress-activated kinase-1 and Histone H3 are summarized, 
      along with an evaluation of the role of cannabinoid and nicotinic acetylcholine 
      receptors. The role of synaptic plasticity and animal behavioral results on 
      dyskinesia are also evaluated. The most recent therapeutic advances to treat 
      Parkinson's disease are discussed, with emphasis on the possibilities and 
      limitations of non-pharmacological interventions such as physical activity, deep 
      brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic field stimulation and cell replacement 
      therapy. The review suggests new prospects for the management of Parkinson's 
      disease-associated motor symptoms, especially the development of dyskinesia. This 
      review aims at summarizing the key molecular mechanisms underlying dyskinesia and 
      the most recent therapeutic advances to treat Parkinson's disease with emphasis 
      on non-pharmacological interventions such as physical activity, deep brain 
      stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic field stimulation (TMS) and cell 
      replacement therapy. These new interventions are discussed from both the 
      experimental and clinical point of view, describing their current strength and 
      limitations.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to improve mood and motor function 
      in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 84-96
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain 
      stimulation technique that can produce lasting changes in excitability and 
      activity in cortical regions underneath the stimulation coil (local effect), but 
      also within functionally connected cortical or subcortical regions (remote 
      effects). Since the clinical presentation of Parkinson's disease (PD) is related 
      to abnormal neuronal activity within the basal ganglia and cortical regions, 
      including the primary motor cortex, the premotor cortex and the prefrontal 
      cortex, several studies have used rTMS to improve brain function in PD. Here, we 
      review the studies that have investigated the possible therapeutic effects of 
      rTMS on mood and motor function in PD patients. We highlight some methodological 
      inconsistencies and problems, including the difficulty to define the most 
      effective protocol for rTMS or to establish an appropriate placebo condition. We 
      finally propose future directions of research that may help to improve the 
      therapeutic efficacy of rTMS in PD.

TI  - Prazosin for the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of 
      dementia.
LID - 10.7573/dic.2022-3-3 [doi]
LID - 2022-3-3
AB  - Prazosin, a centrally acting α1 adrenoceptor antagonist, has been included in two 
      published algorithms amongst the list of medications that may be used in the 
      management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). However, 
      a review of PubMed, Ovid and Cochrane Collaboration found that there was only one 
      small published randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated the use of 
      prazosin amongst individuals with BPSD. Evidence from this good quality RCT 
      indicates that prazosin appears to benefit individuals with agitation and 
      aggression amongst individuals with BPSD and this medication is well tolerated. 
      When compared to other treatments for BPSD, including atypical antipsychotics, 
      antidepressants, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, where there are 
      multiple studies for each of these treatment modalities, the data for the use of 
      prazosin for BPSD are limited to just one good quality RCT. Given the limitations 
      in available data, the routine use of prazosin for the treatment of BPSD cannot 
      be recommended at this time. However, prazosin may be used for the management of 
      agitation and aggression amongst individuals with dementia when other medication 
      classes, like acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, antidepressants and/or 
      atypical antipsychotics, have been ineffective or not tolerated.

TI  - High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) on global 
      cognitive function of elderly in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 13-25
LID - 10.1007/s10072-023-07072-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) 
      is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique used to improve cognitive deficits 
      in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This systematic review and 
      meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of HF-rTMS in improving global 
      cognitive function rehabilitation in elderly patients with mild to moderate AD. 
      METHODS: A detailed literature search of publications using ten databases 
      (Chinese: Wanfang, VIP Periodical, SinoMed, the Chinese National Knowledge 
      Infrastructure; English: PubMed, Embase, OVID, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, 
      and EBSCOhost) was performed to identify English and Chinese language articles 
      published up to December 2022. We only included randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) that evaluate the effect of HF-rTMS on elderly patients with mild to 
      moderate AD. The retrieved studies were carefully reviewed, extracted data, and 
      assessed quality. RESULTS: Seventeen studies, including 1161 elderly patients 
      with mild to moderate AD, were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to the 
      control group, HF-rTMS could increase MMSE (mean difference [MD] = 3.64; 95%CI 
      1.86-5.42; P < 0.0001), MoCA (MD = 3.69; 95%CI 1.84-5.54; P < 0.0001), P300 
      amplitude (MD = 1.09; 95%CI 0.45-1.72; P = 0.0008), and total effective rate 
      scores (MD = 3.64; 95% CI 2.14-6.18; P < 0.00001) while decreasing ADAS-Cog 
      (MD =  - 3.53; 95%CI - 4.91- - 2.15; P < 0.00001) and P300 latency scores 
      (MD =  - 38.32; 95%CI - 72.40- - 4.24; P = 0.03). Our study showed that HF-rTMS 
      could improve the global cognitive function of elderly patients with mild to 
      moderate AD. CONCLUSION: HF-rTMS can improve global cognitive function in elderly 
      patients with mild to moderate AD, which is an effective and safe rehabilitation 
      treatment tool for AD patients.

TI  - Treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia using transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation: a systematic review.
PG  - 611-622
LID - 10.1017/S1041610223000091 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are a group 
      of noncognitive symptoms that occur commonly among individuals with dementia. 
      These symptoms worsen the morbidity and mortality among individuals with dementia 
      and significantly increase the cost of caring for these individuals. Transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been shown to have some benefits in the treatment 
      of BPSD. This review provides an updated summary of the effect of TMS on BPSD. 
      METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane, and Ovid databases 
      on the use of TMS to treat BPSD. RESULTS: We found 11 randomized controlled 
      studies that evaluated the use of TMS among individuals with BPSD. Three of these 
      studies examined the effect of TMS on apathy, two of which showed significant 
      benefit. Seven studies showed that TMS significantly improves BPSD: six using 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and one using transcranial 
      direct current stimulation (tDCS). Four studies, two evaluating tDCS, one 
      evaluating rTMS, and one evaluating intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) 
      showed a nonsignificant impact of TMS on BPSD. Adverse events were predominantly 
      mild and transitory in all studies. CONCLUSION: Available data from this review 
      indicate that rTMS is beneficial for individuals with BPSD, especially among 
      individuals with apathy, and is well tolerated. However, more data are needed to 
      prove the efficacy of tDCS and iTBS. Additionally, more randomized controlled 
      trials with longer treatment follow-up and standardized use of BPSD assessments 
      are needed to determine the best dose, duration, and modality for effective 
      treatment of BPSD.

TI  - Functional neuroimaging and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in 
      Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Functional neuroimaging provides insights into the pathogenesis of motor symptoms 
      in Parkinson's disease (PD) and improves our understanding of both established 
      neuromodulatory therapies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and potential ones 
      such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Functional imaging 
      studies can reveal the consequences of the dopaminergic lesion in PD among a 
      widespread network of subcortical-cortical regions. Characteristic patterns of 
      normal cortical brain activation for motor tasks are systematically altered in 
      PD. Recent work has emphasized the task dependence of these changes and their 
      gradual evolution over the course of the disease. Clinically relevant PD 
      treatment with medications or DBS tends to normalize these patterns. In this 
      context, rTMS is discussed as a potential noninvasive alternative for 
      neuromodulation of cortical function. Although rTMS is not a current treatment, 
      we review recent rTMS studies in PD that suggest its promise, illustrate how 
      functional imaging can guide application of rTMS, and suggest that subcortical 
      dopamine release could be an rTMS mechanism of action. The combination of rTMS 
      and functional neuroimaging broadens our knowledge of functional cortical 
      networks in PD, which can eventually provide physicians with pathophysiologic 
      information about different PD treatment options and rationales for 
      neuromodulatory interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effects and optimal parameters of repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on cognition function of patients with 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and to estimate which cognitive function may obtain more 
      benefits from rTMS. METHOD: The articles dealing with rTMS on cognitive function 
      of PD patients were retrieved from the databases until April 2019. Outcomes of 
      global cognitive function and different cognitive domains were extracted. The 
      standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 
      cognitive outcome for different parameters, scales, and cognitive functions were 
      estimated. RESULTS: Fourteen studies involving 173 subjects were included in this 
      meta-analysis. A significant effect size was observed with the mini-mental state 
      examination (MMSE) for the global cognitive outcome based on the evidence of four 
      published articles. Further subtests for different cognitive domains demonstrated 
      prominent effect for the executive function. The significant effect sizes for 
      executive function were found with multiple sessions of high-frequency rTMS over 
      frontal cortex; especially over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). All of 
      the other cognitive domains, which included memory, attention, and language 
      ability, did not obtain significant effects. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple sessions of 
      high-frequency rTMS over the DLPFC may have positive effect on executive function 
      in PD patients. Further well designed studies with large sample sizes are needed 
      to verify our results and ascertain the long-term effects of rTMS.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) represents a promising tool 
      for studying and influencing cognition in people with neurodegenerative diseases. 
      This procedure is noninvasive and painless, and it does not require the use of 
      anesthesia or pharmacological substances. In this systematic critical review we 
      report outcomes from research focused on behavioral cognitive effects induced by 
      rTMS in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and 
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) preceding AD. There are still major limitations 
      to rTMS use, such as a poor understanding of its after-effects and 
      inter-individual variability in their magnitude, discrepancies in stimulation 
      protocols and study designs, varied selection of the specific stimulated areas 
      and control procedures, and neuropsychological methods for assessment of 
      after-effects; hence, the results of the present research can only be considered 
      preliminary. The future directions are discussed.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and 
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in memory deficits in patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease: Meta-analysis and systematic review.
PG  - 100452

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS) are two of the most used non-pharmacological 
      interventions for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, most of the clinical trials 
      have focused on evaluating the effects on global cognition and not on specific 
      cognitive functions. Therefore, considering that memory loss is one of the 
      hallmark symptoms of AD, we aim to assess the efficacy and safety of tDCS and 
      rTMS in memory deficits. For that, multilevel random effect models were performed 
      considering the standardized mean difference (SMD) between active and sham 
      stimulation. A total of 19 studies with 411 participants demonstrated positive 
      effects in memory after tDCS (SMD=0.20, p = 0.04) and rTMS (SMD=0.44, p = 0.001). 
      Subgroup analysis revealed that tDCS had greater efficacy when administered in 
      temporal regions (SMD=0.32, p = 0.04), whereas rTMS was superior when applied in 
      frontal regions (SMD=0.61, p < 0.001). Therefore, depending on the brain region 
      of stimulation, both interventions produced a positive effect on memory symptoms 
      in AD patients. Finally, the safety of both techniques was observed in the AD 
      population after the reporting of almost no serious events.

AB  - Usually, cortical rhythmic activities are studied with local field potentials. To 
      overcome small amplitude of EEGs easily disturbed by several factors, we 
      developed a new method to study motor cortical rhythm using Motor evoked 
      potentials (MEPs) to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We, here, review 
      triad-conditioning TMS technique for investigating the intrinsic rhythm of the 
      human primary motor cortex (M1). MEP was recorded from the first dorsal 
      interosseous muscle (FDI). TMS was applied over the M1 to study its frequency 
      dependency. In the intervention condition, the subthreshold, same intensity three 
      conditioning stimuli separated by a certain interval were given prior to the 
      supra-threshold test stimulus. In the control condition, the test stimulus was 
      given alone. MEPs were compared between the two conditions. In healthy 
      volunteers, triad-conditioning stimulus (TCS) at an interval of 25 ms induced MEP 
      facilitation, whereas the other intervals TCS induced no facilitation. This 
      frequency dependent facilitation may reflect some intrinsic rhythm of M1 (25 ms, 
      i.e. 40 Hz). In cortical myoclonus, the 40 ms TCS induced facilitation whereas 
      25 ms TCS induced no facilitation, which is consistent with abnormal rhythm of M1 
      at 25 Hz (40 ms interval) reported previously. In Parkinson's disease (PD), 25 ms 
      TCS evoked no facilitation. Triad-conditioning TMS may enable us to investigate 
      the intrinsic rhythmic activity of M1 and its abnormality.

      dementia.

LID - 2022-8-3
AB  - Propranolol is a β-adrenergic antagonist used in the management of hypertension, 
      cardiac arrhythmia, and angina pectoris. There is some evidence that propranolol 
      may benefit individuals with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia 
      (BPSD). A total of three case series, one randomized controlled trial and one 
      case report were identified (from a literature search of three major databases: 
      PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane collaboration) that assessed the use of propranolol 
      for the management of BPSD. From these studies, it appears that propranolol 
      improves BPSD, including agitation and aggression. Propranolol is also well 
      tolerated with no significant bradycardia or hypotension noted in these studies. 
      Current data on the use of propranolol for the management of BPSD are limited in 
      comparison to other pharmacological agents (atypical antipsychotics, 
      antidepressants, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and cannabinoids) 
      and treatment modalities (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and 
      electroconvulsive therapy). The efficacy and safety of these treatments among 
      individuals with BPSD has been evaluated in multiple controlled studies. In 
      clinical practice, the routine use of propranolol among people with BPSD cannot 
      be recommended at this time given the limited data. However, propranolol can be 
      trialled among individuals with BPSD when symptoms have not responded adequately 
      to other medications. Propranolol may also be used prior to embarking on trials 
      of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy 
      among people with BPSD given the greater acceptance of this medication in the 
      general population.

      of the human brain and cranial nerves. The method is in use since 1985. 
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation can use single stimuli, pairs of stimuli 
      separated by different intervals (to the same or to several brain areas), or 
      trains of repetitive stimuli at various frequencies. Single stimuli give rise to 
      motor evoked potentials that have clinical use and serve diagnostic and 
      prognostic purposes. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can modify 
      excitability of cerebral cortex. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has 
      opened a new field of investigation of the neural circuitry, and is developing 
      into a therapeutic tool. This general review considers basic principles of 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, discusses methodological aspects and 
      techniques, and analyses their utility in clinical practice.

TI  - Effect of transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation on the cognitive function of individuals with Alzheimer's disease: a 
      systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression.
PG  - 453-465

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation 
      (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the cognitive function of 
      individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: This systematic review with 
      meta-analysis and meta-regression included randomized clinical trials published 
      until 05/2022. We included studies conducted with individuals with AD of both 
      sexes, aged between 55 and 85 years, treated with tDCS, TMS, or both. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-one studies were included in the systematic review and sixteen in the 
      meta-analysis. Meta-regression suggested a significant influence of anodic tDCS 
      with current intensity of 1.5 mA on cognitive function. Significant results were 
      found with treatment frequencies of three and five days a week for two weeks. 
      Subgroup analysis found that anodic tDCS influences cognitive function, 
      regardless of AD stage. Similar was observed for TMS using a frequency of 20 Hz 
      and current intensity of 90% of the resting motor threshold. DISCUSSION: Anodal 
      tDCS and 20 Hz TMS have demonstrated the ability to improve cognitive function in 
      AD by modulating neural activity. These therapies are safe and well-tolerated, 
      offering promise as adjuncts to available pharmacological treatments. Studies 
      with greater methodological rigor and parameter standardization are warranted. 
      Comprehensive investigations involving neuroimaging techniques may provide a 
      better understanding of the interaction between induced electrical fields and the 
      complex neural networks affected in AD, paving the way for more personalized and 
      effective neurostimulation approaches.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of repetitive 
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on motor signs in Parkinson's disease 
      (PD). Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus bibliographic, and Google 
      Scholar databases were searched. Relevant controlled clinical trials published 
      between January 1985 and October 2007 were extracted, reviewed, and validated 
      according to the study protocol. The outcome of interest was the motor section of 
      the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). We calculated the effect 
      size for the included studies. Sensitivity analysis was performed to further 
      assess factors that may change the results. Ten randomized, controlled clinical 
      trials were included in the meta-analysis. Pooling of the results from these 
      trials yielded an effect size of -0.58 in UPDRS for high-frequency rTMS studies 
      and no significant effects for low-frequency rTMS studies. The benefit of 
      high-frequency rTMS on motor signs in PD was confirmed by the meta-analysis. 
      Lower frequency rTMS had little effect on motor signs in PD.

TI  - Depression in Parkinson disease--epidemiology, mechanisms and management.
PG  - 35-47
LID - 10.1038/nrneurol.2011.189 [doi]
AB  - Depression occurs in around 35% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and is 
      often persistent. Symptoms of depression can be evident in individuals at the 
      time of diagnosis and might develop in the premotor stage of the disease. The 
      underlying mechanisms of depression in PD are not known in detail, but changes in 
      brain structure, signaling by neurotransmitters, and levels of inflammatory and 
      neurotrophic factors are all suggested to contribute to its development. 
      Psychosocial factors and pain could also have roles in depression. Changes in 
      dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems in patients with PD might 
      help to explain the incidence of depression in these individuals. Antidepressants 
      that have dual serotonergic and noradrenergic effects are the drugs of choice for 
      treating depression in PD. However, antiparkinsonian drugs might have beneficial 
      effects not only on the motor symptoms of disease, but also on a patient's mood. 
      Deep brain stimulation can worsen depression in some patients, but a preliminary 
      study has suggested that transcranial magnetic stimulation could improve symptoms 
      of depression. This Review describes the frequency and course of depression in 
      patients with PD. The mechanisms that underlie depression in this disease are 
      also discussed, and the management strategies for these patients are highlighted.

TI  - Noninvasive brain stimulation in Alzheimer's disease: systematic review and 
      perspectives for the future.
PG  - 611-27
LID - 10.1016/j.exger.2011.04.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of studies have applied transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS) to physiologically characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to monitor 
      effects of pharmacological agents, while others have begun to therapeutically use 
      TMS and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to improve cognitive 
      function in AD. These applications are still very early in development, but offer 
      the opportunity of learning from them for future development. METHODS: We 
      performed a systematic search of all studies using noninvasive stimulation in AD 
      and reviewed all 29 identified articles. Twenty-four focused on measures of motor 
      cortical reactivity and (local) plasticity and functional connectivity, with 
      eight of these studies assessing also effects of pharmacological agents. Five 
      studies focused on the enhancement of cognitive function in AD. RESULTS: 
      Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and resting motor threshold are 
      significantly reduced in AD patients as compared to healthy elders. Results on 
      other measures of cortical reactivity, e.g. intracortical inhibition (ICI), are 
      more divergent. Acetylcholine-esterase inhibitors and dopaminergic drugs may 
      increase SAI and ICI in AD. Motor cortical plasticity and connectivity are 
      impaired in AD. TMS/tDCS can induce acute and short-duration beneficial effects 
      on cognitive function, but the therapeutic clinical significance in AD is 
      unclear. Safety of TMS/tDCS is supported by studies to date. CONCLUSIONS: 
      TMS/tDCS appears safe in AD, but longer-term risks have been insufficiently 
      considered. TMS holds promise as a physiologic biomarker in AD to identify 
      therapeutic targets and monitor pharmacologic effects. In addition, TMS/tDCS may 
      have therapeutic utility in AD, though the evidence is still very preliminary and 
      cautious interpretation is warranted.

TI  - Cortical influences drive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 917-924
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2017-315573 [doi]
AB  - The early motor manifestations of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
      while rarely documented, reflect failure of adaptive complex motor skills. The 
      development of these skills correlates with progressive evolution of a direct 
      corticomotoneuronal system that is unique to primates and markedly enhanced in 
      humans. The failure of this system in ALS may translate into the split hand 
      presentation, gait disturbance, split leg syndrome and bulbar symptomatology 
      related to vocalisation and breathing, and possibly diffuse fasciculation, 
      characteristic of ALS. Clinical neurophysiology of the brain employing 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation has convincingly demonstrated a presymptomatic 
      reduction or absence of short interval intracortical inhibition, accompanied by 
      increased intracortical facilitation, indicating cortical hyperexcitability. The 
      hallmark of the TDP-43 pathological signature of sporadic ALS is restricted to 
      cortical areas as well as to subcortical nuclei that are under the direct control 
      of corticofugal projections. This provides anatomical support that the origins of 
      the TDP-43 pathology reside in the cerebral cortex itself, secondarily in 
      corticofugal fibres and the subcortical targets with which they make monosynaptic 
      connections. The latter feature explains the multisystem degeneration that 
      characterises ALS. Consideration of ALS as a primary neurodegenerative disorder 
      of the human brain may incorporate concepts of prion-like spread at synaptic 
      terminals of corticofugal axons. Further, such a concept could explain the 
      recognised widespread imaging abnormalities of the ALS neocortex and the accepted 
      relationship between ALS and frontotemporal dementia.

TI  - Cognitive Training and Noninvasive Brain Stimulation for Cognition in Parkinson's 
      Disease: A Meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many people with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience cognitive 
      decline. It is not known whether cognitive training or noninvasive brain 
      stimulation are effective at alleviating cognitive deficits in PD. OBJECTIVE: To 
      examine cognitive training and non-invasive brain stimulation interventions for 
      cognition in PD. METHODS: An extensive search was conducted of published and 
      unpublished studies in online databases. Studies were selected if they were 
      controlled trials examining standard (not individualized) or tailored 
      (individualized) cognitive training, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (rTMS), or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in PD, with outcomes 
      measured by standardized neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Fourteen controlled 
      trials met inclusion criteria. For executive function, the pooled effect size 
      (Hedges' g) for cognitive training (standard and tailored combined) was small ( g 
      = 0.42) but statistically significant (95% CI 0.15-0.68). The pooled effect for 
      standard cognitive training (alone) was medium ( g = 0.51) and significant (95% 
      CI 0.16-0.85). For attention/working memory, small pooled effect sizes were found 
      when combining standard and tailored cognitive training ( g = 0.23; 95% CI 
      0.02-0.44) and for standard cognitive training alone ( g = 0.29; 95% CI 
      0.04-0.53), both significant. For memory, small but significant pooled effect 
      sizes were also found when combining standard and tailored cognitive training and 
      for standard cognitive training alone. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that 
      standard and tailored cognitive training may improve executive function, 
      attention/working memory, and memory in PD. Future studies must adopt randomized 
      controlled trial designs to explore the therapeutic potential of these 
      interventions.

      review.
PG  - 1367-77
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive means of electrically 
      stimulating neurons in the human cerebral cortex, is able to modify neuronal 
      activity locally and at distant sites when delivered in series or trains of 
      pulses. Data from stimulation of the motor cortex suggest that the type of effect 
      on the excitability of the cortical network depends on the frequency of 
      stimulation. These data, as well as results from studies in rodents, have been 
      generalized across brain areas and species to provide rationales for using 
      repetitive TMS (rTMS) to treat various brain disorders, most notably depression. 
      Research into clinical applications for TMS remains active and has the potential 
      to provide useful data, but, to date, the results of blinded, sham-controlled 
      trials do not provide clear evidence of beneficial effects that replace or even 
      match the effectiveness of conventional treatments in any disorder. In this 
      review, we discuss the clinical and scientific bases for using rTMS as treatment, 
      and review the results of trials in psychiatric and neurological disorders to 
      date.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and non-invasive 
      technique. In recent years, many studies have demonstrated that rTMS can improve 
      cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and has potential as a 
      therapeutic method for AD. However, the efficacy varies greatly with different 
      rTMS treatment regimens, which is related to the frequency, type, location,

      that high-frequency stimulation is superior to low-frequency stimulation; 
      efficacy of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is similar to that of 
      conventional rTMS, but iTBS treatment session is shorter and might be more 
      acceptable for AD patients; rTMS stimulation sites targeting AD-damaged brain 
      regions or associated networks would be more effective; short-term intensive 
      treatment combined with long-term maintenance treatment can gain long-term 
      efficacy; dynamic adjustment of stimulus intensity combined with the degree of 
      cognitive impairment can enhance the efficacy; functional connection based on 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging may improve the focusing power of rTMS. In

TI  - Diagnostics of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Up to Date.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics11020231 [doi]
LID - 231
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by gradual loss of upper and lower motor neurons and their 
      pathways, usually without affecting the extraocular and sphincter muscles. The 
      cause of the disease is not yet known. It is a chain of subsequent events, ending 
      in programmed cell death in selective neuronal subpopulations. The prognosis for 
      survival is rather short with a median of 2 to 4 years. Survival may be prolonged 
      based on prompt diagnosis, ALS subtype and proper management with supportive 
      treatment (tracheostomy, gastrostomy, etc.). According to the clinical picture, 
      the typical form of ALS with upper and lower motoneuron involvement and 
      progressive bulbar paralysis with bulbar muscle involvement is observed. The ALS 
      form with progressive muscle atrophy, where only the lower motoneuron is 
      affected, and primary lateral sclerosis with only upper motoneuron damage are 
      rare. Familiar forms of ALS (FALS) associated with specific genes (the most 
      common is C9orf72) have been discovered. FALS is usually associated with dementia 
      (frontotemporal lobar dementia, FTLD), behavioral disorders, cognitive 
      dysfunction and impairment of executive functions. The diagnosis of ALS is 
      determined by excluding other conditions and utilizing clinical examinations, 
      laboratory and genetic tests and nerve conduction/needle electromyography studies 
      (EMG). Needle EMG records abnormal activities at rest and looks for neurogenic 
      patterns during muscle contraction. Motor evoked potentials after transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation remain the test of choice to identify impairment of upper 
      motor neurons. New biochemical, neurophysiological and morphological biomarkers 
      are extensively studied as early diagnostic and prognostic factors and have 
      implications for clinical trials, research and drug development.

TI  - Does repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improve cognitive function in 
      age-related neurodegenerative diseases? A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e5974
LID - 10.1002/gps.5974 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: High-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) 
      targeted over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is widely used in 
      research to promote neuroplasticity and cognitive enhancement. RTMS is a 
      promising intervention to tackle cognitive decline in people with age-related 
      neurodegenerative diseases. However, there is currently no systematic evidence 
      examining the effects of DLPFC-targeted, high-frequency rTMS on cognitive 
      function in this population. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate 
      the efficacy and moderators of this treatment intervention. METHODS: A 
      comprehensive literature search of five electronic databases was performed to 
      identify articles published before October, 2022. Following PRISMA guidelines, 
      the identified articles were screened, data was extracted, and the methodological 
      quality was assessed using the Cochrane tool, Risk of Bias 2. Meta-analyses were 
      performed using R Studio (v.4.1.2). RESULTS: Sixteen studies involving 474 
      participants met the inclusion criteria, of which 8 studies measured global 
      cognitive function. The results from the random-effects meta-analysis showed rTMS 
      significantly improved global cognitive function relative to control groups shown 
      by a large, significant effect size (g = 1.39, 95% CI, 0.34-2.43; p = 0.017). No 
      significant effects were found between subgroups or for individual cognitive 
      domains. CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency rTMS, targeted over the DLPFC, appears to 
      improve global cognitive function in people with age-related neurodegenerative 
      diseases. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the 
      small number of studies included, and high between-study heterogeneity.

TI  - Sensory abnormalities and pain in Parkinson disease and its modulation by 
      treatment of motor symptoms.
PG  - 151-65
LID - 10.1002/ejp.745 [doi]
AB  - Pain and sensory abnormalities are present in a large proportion of Parkinson 
      disease (PD) patients and have a significant negative impact in quality of life. 
      It remains undetermined whether pain occurs secondary to motor impairment and to 
      which extent it can be relieved by improvement of motor symptoms. The aim of this 
      review was to examine the current knowledge on the mechanisms behind sensory 
      changes and pain in PD and to assess the modulatory effects of motor treatment on 
      these sensory abnormalities. A comprehensive literature search was performed. We 
      selected studies investigating sensory changes and pain in PD and the effects of 
      levodopa administration and deep brain stimulation (DBS) on these symptoms. PD 
      patients have altered sensory and pain thresholds in the off-medication state. 
      Both levodopa and DBS improve motor symptoms (i.e.: bradykinesia, tremor) and 
      change sensory abnormalities towards normal levels. However, there is no direct 
      correlation between sensory/pain changes and motor improvement, suggesting that 
      motor and non-motor symptoms do not necessarily share the same mechanisms. 
      Whether dopamine and DBS have a real antinociceptive effect or simply a 
      modulatory effect in pain perception remain uncertain. These data may provide 
      useful insights into a mechanism-based approach to pain in PD, pointing out the 
      role of the dopaminergic system in pain perception and the importance of the 
      characterization of different pain syndromes related to PD before specific 
      treatment can be instituted.

TI  - Therapies for Parkinson's diseases: alternatives to current pharmacological 
      interventions.
PG  - 1279-1299
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by the selective and progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the 
      substantia nigra pars compacta. Although PD has been heavily researched, the 
      precise etiology and pathogenesis for PD are still inconclusive. Consequently, 
      current pharmacological treatments for PD are largely symptomatic rather than 
      preventive and there is still no cure for this disease nowadays. Moreover, 
      nonmotor symptoms caused by intrinsic PD pathology or side effects induced by 
      currently used pharmacological interventions are gaining increasing attention and 
      urgently need to be treated due to their influence on quality of life. As ancient 
      traditional healing systems, Tai Chi, Yoga, acupuncture and natural products have 
      long been considered as complementary or alternative therapeutic options for PD. 
      Recently, several newly developed non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies, 
      including deep brain stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, 
      near-infrared light, gene therapy and cell replacement therapy, have also been 
      suggested to give benefits to relieve parkinsonian symptoms. This review will 
      summarize and update the therapeutic potential and the most recent research 
      progresses of these traditional and modern therapeutic options and highlight 
      their clinical meaning for the therapy of not only PD but also other 
      neurodegenerative diseases.

      Parkinson's Disease.

AB  - Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). 
      Although FOG reduces quality of life, affects mobility and increases the risk of 
      falls, there are little to no effective treatments to alleviate FOG. Non-invasive 
      brain stimulation (NIBS) has recently yielded attention as a potential treatment 
      to reduce FOG symptoms however, stimulation parameters and protocols remain 
      inconsistent and require further research. Specifically, targets for stimulation 
      require careful review. Thus, with current neuroimaging and 
      neuro-electrophysiological evidence, we consider potential cortical targets 
      thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of FOG according to the 
      Interference model, and within reach of NIBS. We note that the primary motor 
      cortex, the supplementary motor area and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have 
      already drawn attention as NIBS targets for FOG, but based on neuroimaging 
      evidence the premotor cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, the cerebellum, and 
      more particularly, the posterior parietal cortex should be considered as 
      potential regions for stimulation. We also discuss different methodological 
      considerations, such as stimulation type, medication state, and hemisphere to 
      target, and future perspectives for NIBS protocols in FOG.

TI  - TMS-EEG Co-Registration in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's 
      Disease and Other Dementias: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11030303 [doi]
LID - 303
AB  - An established method to assess effective brain connectivity is the combined use 
      of transcranial magnetic stimulation with simultaneous electroencephalography 
      (TMS-EEG) because TMS-induced cortical responses propagate to distant 
      anatomically connected brain areas. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias 
      are associated with changes in brain networks and connectivity, but the 
      underlying pathophysiology of these processes is poorly defined. We performed 
      here a systematic review of the studies employing TMS-EEG co-registration in 
      patients with dementias. TMS-EEG studies targeting the motor cortex have revealed 
      a significantly reduced TMS-evoked P30 in AD patients in the temporo-parietal 
      cortex ipsilateral to stimulation side as well as in the contralateral 
      fronto-central area, and we have demonstrated a deep rearrangement of the 
      sensorimotor system even in mild AD patients. TMS-EEG studies targeting other 
      cortical areas showed alterations of effective dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      connectivity as well as an inverse correlation between prefrontal-to-parietal 
      connectivity and cognitive impairment. Moreover, TMS-EEG analysis showed a 
      selective increase in precuneus neural activity. TMS-EEG co-registrations can 
      also been used to investigate whether different drugs may affect cognitive 
      functions in patients with dementias.

TI  - Stimulating Memory: Reviewing Interventions Using Repetitive Transcranial 
      Magnetic Stimulation to Enhance or Restore Memory Abilities.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11101283 [doi]
LID - 1283
AB  - Human memory systems are imperfect recording devices that are affected by age and 
      disease, but recent findings suggest that the functionality of these systems may 
      be modifiable through interventions using non-invasive brain stimulation such as 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The translational potential 
      of these rTMS interventions is clear: memory problems are the most common 
      cognitive complaint associated with healthy aging, while pathological conditions 
      such as Alzheimer's disease are often associated with severe deficits in memory. 
      Therapies to improve memory or treat memory loss could enhance independence while 
      reducing costs for public health systems. Despite this promise, several important 
      factors limit the generalizability and translational potential of rTMS 
      interventions for memory. Heterogeneity of protocol design, rTMS parameters, and 
      outcome measures present significant challenges to interpretation and 
      reproducibility. However, recent advances in cognitive neuroscience, including 
      rTMS approaches and recent insights regarding functional brain networks, may 
      offer methodological tools necessary to design new interventional studies with 
      enhanced experimental rigor, improved reproducibility, and greater likelihood of 
      successful translation to clinical settings. In this review, we first discuss the 
      current state of the literature on memory modulation with rTMS, then offer a 
      commentary on developments in cognitive neuroscience that are relevant to rTMS 
      interventions, and finally close by offering several recommendations for the 
      design of future investigations using rTMS to modulate human memory performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bladder symptoms are common in Parkinson disease (PD), affecting 
      quality of life. Medications commonly used such as antimuscarinics can cause 
      frequently intolerable side effects, and therefore, new, better tolerated 
      approaches are needed. Neuromodulation techniques have an established role in 
      urologic disorders; these techniques include tibial nerve stimulation (TNS) and 
      sacral neuromodulation (SNM), which are localized therapies lacking the side 
      effects associated with medication. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to undertake a 
      systematic review of the literature reporting the use of neuromodulation 
      techniques for the treatment of bladder symptoms in PD and related conditions. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of data bases was conducted including 
      MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science. Studies were required to present specific 
      outcomes for individuals with PD for neuromodulation interventions. RESULTS: Ten 
      primary studies were identified concerning detailed outcomes of neuromodulation 
      on bladder symptoms in PD, including seven for TNS, one for SNM, and one using 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Two further mixed cohort studies 
      documented minimal data on individuals with PD. All studies demonstrated benefit 
      in a range of outcome measures following neuromodulation. Two randomized 
      sham-controlled studies were carried out using TNS, with one clearly 
      demonstrating superiority over sham, although difficulties with achieving 
      believable yet ineffective sham treatment are highlighted. Further studies 
      reported limited, uncontrolled outcomes of SNM in patients with PD, demonstrating 
      benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from case series suggests benefit from TNS in PD, 
      with limited literature on SNM or TMS. Placebo effect from neuromodulation is a 
      concern, and only limited controlled data exist. Future well-designed and 
      sham-controlled studies need to be completed to provide definitive data on the 
      benefit of neuromodulation in PD. Definitively proving the utility of a 
      neuromodulation modality will allow better treatment of bladder symptoms without 
      the need for pharmacologic measures that cause side effects.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition caused by the 
      degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. It is the most 
      prevalent form of Parkinsonism, categorized by cardinal features such as 
      bradykinesia, rigidity, tremors, and postural instability. Due to the 
      multicentric pathology of PD involving inflammation, oxidative stress, 
      excitotoxicity, apoptosis, and protein aggregation, it has become difficult to 
      pin-point a single therapeutic target and evaluate its potential application. 
      Currently available drugs for treating PD provide only symptomatic relief and do 
      not decrease or avert disease progression resulting in poor patient satisfaction 
      and compliance. Significant amount of understanding concerning the 
      pathophysiology of PD has offered a range of potential targets for PD. Several 
      emerging targets including AAV-hAADC gene therapy, phosphodiesterase-4, potassium 
      channels, myeloperoxidase, acetylcholinesterase, MAO-B, dopamine, A2A, mGlu5, and 
      5-HT-1A/1B receptors are in different stages of clinical development. 
      Additionally, alternative interventions such as deep brain stimulation, 
      thalamotomy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and gamma knife surgery, are also 
      being developed for patients with advanced PD. As much as these therapeutic 
      targets hold potential to delay the onset and reverse the disease, more targets 
      and alternative interventions need to be examined in different stages of PD. In 
      this review, we discuss various emerging preclinical pharmacological targets that 
      may serve as a new promising neuroprotective strategy that could actually help 
      alleviate PD and its symptoms.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia worldwide, has 
      gradually become a global health concern for society and individuals with the 
      process of global ageing. Although extensive research has been carried out on AD, 
      the etiology and pathological mechanism of the disease are still unclear, and 
      there is no specific drug to cure or delay AD progression. The exploration of 
      enhancing nerve regeneration in AD has gradually attracted increasing attention. 
      In the current review, the existing therapeutic strategies were summarized to 
      induce nerve regeneration which can increase the number of neurons, and improve 
      the survival of neurons, the plasticity of synapses and synaptic activity. The 
      strategies include increasing neurotrophic expression (such as brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor), inhibiting acetylcholinesterase 
      (such as donepezil, tacrine, rivastigmine and galanthamine), elevating histone 
      deacetylase levels (such as RGFP-966, Tasquinimod, CM-414 and 44B), stimulating 
      the brain by physiotherapy (such as near-infrared light, repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation) and 
      transplanting exogenous neural stem cells. However, further evaluations need to 
      be performed to determine the optimal treatment. The present study reviews recent 
      interventions for enhancing adult neurogenesis and attempts to elucidate their 
      mechanisms of action, which may provide a theoretical basis for inducing nerve 
      regeneration to fight against AD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic 
      value of transcranial stimulation in pelvic and perineal disorders. METHODS: A 
      literature review (Medline database and Google scholar) with no time limit was 
      performed using keywords: "transcranial direct stimulation", "transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation", "neurogenic bladder", "urinary incontinence", "Parkinson 
      disease", "multiple sclerosis", "stroke", "muscle spasticity", "pelvic pain", 
      "visceral pain". RESULTS: Twelve articles have been selected. Transcranial 
      magnetic or electrical stimulation is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique 
      widely used to establish brain maps to highlight causal relationships between 
      brain and function. Regarding pelvic-perineal disorders, repeated transcranial 
      stimulation has shown significant effects for the treatment of overactive bladder 
      in Parkinson's disease (P<0.05) and multiple sclerosis, but also for the 
      treatment of refractory chronic pelvic pain (P=0.026). Finally, therapeutic 
      effects have also been demonstrated in irritable bowel syndrome. No evidence of 
      efficacy was found on genito-sexual disorders. CONCLUSION: Data from the 
      literature suggest that transcranial stimulation is a noninvasive treatment that 
      may have a role in the management of pelvic and perineal disorders. Its promising 
      field of action would require prospective and randomized studies on a larger 
      scale.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation for Parkinson disease (PD) patients with depression.Methods: A 
      meta-analysis was performed using relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      from online databases such as PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Online Library, and 
      Clinicaltrials.gov. Studies were selected according to pre-defined inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria, and the quality of the studies was evaluated using the Jadad 
      Scale. All data were pooled by RevMan 5.2 software for meta-analysis.Results: The 
      review covered 528 articles, and 7 articles with Jadad score ≥4 were included in 
      the analysis. The meta-analysis showed that, compared to sham repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (sham-rTMS), repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) improved 
      depression, but that there was no significant difference in depression 
      improvement between rTMS and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 
      treatment. In contrast, rTMS over DLPFC did not improve motor function compared 
      to sham-rTMS or SSRI, and the studies that included neurocognitive measures 
      showed no significant difference between rTMS and sham-rTMS.Conclusion: This 
      meta-analysis provides evidence that rTMS over DLPFC can improve depression 
      similar to SSRI treatment, has no effect on the motor function and cognition of 
      PD patients with depression.

TI  - New pharmacological and neuromodulation approaches for impulsive-compulsive 
      behaviors in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 2673-2682
LID - 10.1007/s10072-021-05237-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A significant proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      display a set of impulsive-compulsive behaviors at some point during the course 
      of illness. These behaviors range from the so-called behavioral addictions to 
      dopamine dysregulation syndrome, punding and hoarding disorders. These behaviors 
      have been consistently linked to the use of dopaminergic medications used to 
      treat PD motor symptoms (dopamine agonists, levodopa, and other agents) and less 
      consistently to neuromodulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). 
      Since there are still no approved treatments for these conditions, their 
      pharmacological management is still a big challenge for clinicians. METHODS: We 
      conducted an extensive review of current pharmacological and neuromodulation 
      literature for the management of impulsive-compulsive disorders in PD patients. 
      RESULTS: Pharmacological treatment approaches for impulsive-compulsive behaviors 
      and DDS in PD patients include reduction of levodopa (LD), reduction/cessation of 
      dopamine agonist (DA), and initiation of infusion therapies (apomorphine infusion 
      and duodopa). Also, atomoxetine, a noradrenergic agent approved for the treatment 
      of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, showed some interesting preliminary 
      results but there is still a lack of controlled longitudinal studies. Finally, 
      while DBS effects on impulsive-compulsive disorders are still controversial, 
      non-invasive techniques (such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and 
      transcranial direct current stimulation) could have a potential positive effect 
      but, again, there is still a lack of controlled trials. CONCLUSION: Managing 
      impulsivity and compulsivity in PD patients is still a non-evidence-based 
      challenge for clinicians. Controlled trials on promising approaches such as 
      atomoxetine and non-invasive neuromodulation techniques are needed.

AB  - Brain stimulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) constitute promising clinical and 
      research tools to investigate neural mechanisms underlying neurological and 
      psychiatric diseases. They have enormous potential in modifying brain activity 
      and subsequent function. However, it is still a matter of debate how either of 
      these stimulation approaches operates to produce the clinical outcomes observed 
      in patients. The combination of these techniques with functional neuroimaging is 
      contributing significantly to disentangle the mechanisms through which brain 
      stimulation affects neuronal activity and related networks. In the present review 
      we outline the research done to date on the effects of DBS and TMS on motor, 
      cognition and behaviour in Parkinson's disease (PD) with particular emphasis on 
      neuroimaging.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is becoming a major public-health issue in an aging 
      population. Available approaches to treat advanced PD still have limitations; new 
      therapies are needed. The non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) may offer a 
      complementary approach to treat advanced PD by personalized stimulation. Although 
      NIBS is not as effective as the gold-standard levodopa, recent randomized 
      controlled trials show promising outcomes in the treatment of PD symptoms. 
      Nevertheless, only a few NIBS-stimulation paradigms have shown to improve PD's 
      symptoms. Current clinical recommendations based on the level of evidence are 
      reported in Table 1 through Table 3. Furthermore, novel technological advances 
      hold promise and may soon enable the non-invasive stimulation of deeper brain 
      structures for longer periods.

AB  - This review presents the results of studies investigating the effects of 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TKMS) on motor and non-motor symptoms of 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been found that TKMS reduces the severity of 
      both motor and non-motor disorders without causing serious side-effects. Magnetic 
      field therapy can be combined with pharmacological and non-drug therapies, 
      including the use of dopaminergic therapy, antidepressants and anti-dementia 
      drugs, as well as stereotactic operations. It is necessary to continue the study 
      of the influence of TKMS on the severity of PD symptoms using different 
      electromagnetic characteristics.

AB  - The awareness of the global trends in neuroscience study, especially in the 
      cognitive neuroscience field, should be increased. One notable approach is the 
      use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) not only as a research tool but 
      also as a choice for treatment and rehabilitation in neurological disorders, such 
      as post-stroke hemiplegia, visuospatial neglect syndrome, Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) and psychiatric conditions such as major depression and schizophrenia. All 
      of these occur in significant numbers in highly populated regions. This paper 
      briefly discusses the basic protocols and potential benefits of using TMS with 
      the aim of providing insight that is useful in the design of future public health 
      strategies in highly populated regions with a large neurocognitive burden of 
      disease where this technique is currently underemployed.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recent research and clinical studies pertaining to 
      the nature, diagnosis, and treatment of speech and swallowing disorders in 
      Parkinson disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Although some studies indicate improvement in 
      voice and speech with dopamine therapy and deep brain stimulation of the 
      subthalamic nucleus, others show minimal or adverse effects. Repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation of the mouth motor cortex and injection of 
      collagen in the vocal folds have preliminary data supporting improvement in 
      phonation in people with Parkinson disease. Treatments focusing on vocal 
      loudness, specifically LSVT LOUD (Lee Silverman Voice Treatment), have been 
      effective for the treatment of speech disorders in Parkinson disease. Changes in 
      brain activity due to LSVT LOUD provide preliminary evidence for neural 
      plasticity. Computer-based technology makes the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment 
      available to a large number of users. A rat model for studying neuropharmacologic 
      effects on vocalization in Parkinson disease has been developed. New diagnostic 
      methods of speech and swallowing are also available as the result of recent 
      studies. SUMMARY: Speech rehabilitation with the LSVT LOUD is highly efficacious 
      and scientifically tested. There is a need for more studies to improve 
      understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of speech and swallowing 
      disorders in Parkinson disease.

AB  - Individuals post-stroke sustain motor deficits years after the stroke. Despite 
      recent advancements in the applications of non-invasive brain stimulation 
      techniques and Deep Brain Stimulation in humans, there is a lack of evidence 
      supporting their use for rehabilitation after brain lesions. Non-invasive brain 
      stimulation is already in use for treating motor deficits in individuals with 
      Parkinson's disease and post-stroke. Deep Brain Stimulation has become an 
      established treatment for individuals with movement disorders, such as 
      Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, epilepsy, cerebral palsy and dystonia. It 
      has also been utilized for the treatment of Tourette's syndrome, Alzheimer's 
      disease and neuropsychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
      major depression and anorexia nervosa. There exists growing scientific knowledge 
      from animal studies supporting the use of Deep Brain Stimulation to enhance motor 
      recovery after brain damage. Nevertheless, these results are currently not 
      applicable to humans. This review details the current literature supporting the 
      use of these techniques to enhance motor recovery, both from human and animal 
      studies, aiming to encourage development in this domain.

PG  - 383-390

AB  - Nonpharmacological treatment strategies in Parkinson' disease include 
      heterogeneous treatment modalities, such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, 
      speech therapy, cognitive training and deep brain stimulation as well as 
      noninvasive brain stimulation strategies. Even in the early stages of Parkinson's 
      disease nonpharmacological interventions, such as active exercise therapy and 
      speech therapy can be indicated taking the individual symptoms of a patient into 
      account. Mild cognitive deficits are frequently detected in the course of the 
      disease and progression of these disorders to dementia in the advanced stages of 
      the disease is not uncommon. The starting point for a cognitive training, 
      training strategy and training frequency is unknown and currently under 
      investigation. Deep brain stimulation is an established treatment modality, which 
      should be considered when motor fluctuations cannot be adequately controlled by 
      pharmacological treatment. This therapeutic option depends on patient-specific 
      needs and has to be managed by a multiprofessional team. Non-invasive 
      neurostimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and 
      transcranial direct current stimulation are experimental tools and cannot 
      currently be recommended for general use.

      meta-analysis of its efficacy as a function of protocol characteristics and 
      degree of personalization.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common type of neurodegenerative 
      disorder. Although our knowledge on the causes of AD remains limited and no 
      curative treatments are available, several interventions have been proposed in 
      trying to improve patients' symptomatology. Among those, transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (TMS) has been shown a promising, safe and noninvasive intervention 
      to improve global cognitive functioning. Nevertheless, we currently lack 
      agreement between research studies on the optimal stimulation protocol yielding 
      the highest efficacy in these patients. To answer this query, we conducted a 
      systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus databases and 
      meta-analysis of studies published in the last 10 years (2010-2021) according to 
      the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      guidelines. Differently from prior published meta-analytic work, we investigated 
      whether protocols that considered participants-specific neuroimaging scans for 
      the selection of individualized stimulation targets held more successful outcomes 
      compared to those relying on a generalized targeting selection criteria. We then 
      compared the effect sizes of subsets of studies based on additional protocol 
      characteristics (frequency, duration of intervention, number of stimulation 
      sites, use of concomitant cognitive training and patients' educational level). 
      Our results confirm TMS efficacy in improving global cognitive functioning in 
      mild-to-moderate AD patients, but also highlight the flaws of current protocols 
      characteristics, including a possible lack of sufficient personalization in 
      stimulation protocols.

AB  - Hypokinetic dysarthria (HD) occurs in 90% of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. 
      It manifests specifically in the areas of articulation, phonation, prosody, 
      speech fluency, and faciokinesis. We aimed to systematically review papers on HD 
      in PD with a special focus on (1) early PD diagnosis and monitoring of the 
      disease progression using acoustic voice and speech analysis, and (2) functional 
      imaging studies exploring neural correlates of HD in PD, and (3) clinical studies 
      using acoustic analysis to evaluate effects of dopaminergic medication and brain 
      stimulation. A systematic literature search of articles written in English before 
      March 2016 was conducted in the Web of Science, PubMed, SpringerLink, and IEEE 
      Xplore databases using and combining specific relevant keywords. Articles were 
      categorized into three groups: (1) articles focused on neural correlates of HD in 
      PD using functional imaging (n = 13); (2) articles dealing with the acoustic 
      analysis of HD in PD (n = 52); and (3) articles concerning specifically 
      dopaminergic and brain stimulation-related effects as assessed by acoustic 
      analysis (n = 31); the groups were then reviewed. We identified 14 combinations 
      of speech tasks and acoustic features that can be recommended for use in 
      describing the main features of HD in PD. While only a few acoustic parameters 
      correlate with limb motor symptoms and can be partially relieved by dopaminergic 
      medication, HD in PD seems to be mainly related to non-dopaminergic deficits and 
      associated particularly with non-motor symptoms. Future studies should combine 
      non-invasive brain stimulation with voice behavior approaches to achieve the best 
      treatment effects by enhancing auditory-motor integration.

AB  - In repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), repetitive cortical 
      stimulation induces after-effects, and rTMS has been applied as a treatment for 
      various neurological or psychiatric disorders. Animal studies demonstrated that 
      cortical stimulation could improve Parkinsonism, and a meta-analysis of clinical 
      studies showed efficacy of high frequency rTMS. We conducted two clinical trials 
      of supplementary motor area rTMS therapy for Parkinson's disease, and reported 
      long-lasting efficacy. Other studies targeted specified aspects of Parkinson's 
      disease, or utilized newly developed stimulation protocols. rTMS therapy for PD 
      is a promising area, and can be an important treatment option in the near future.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method to identify markers of 
      treatment response in major depressive disorder (MDD). In this review, existing 
      literature was assessed to determine how EEG markers change with different 
      modalities of MDD treatments, and to synthesize the breadth of EEG markers used 
      in conjunction with MDD treatments. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from 2000 to 
      2021 for studies reporting resting EEG (rEEG) and transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation combined with EEG (TMS-EEG) measures in patients undergoing MDD 
      treatments. The search yielded 966 articles, 204 underwent full-text screening, 
      and 51 studies were included for a narrative synthesis of findings along with 
      confidence in the evidence. In rEEG studies, non-linear quantitative algorithms 
      such as theta cordance and theta current density show higher predictive value 
      than traditional linear metrics. Although less abundant, TMS-EEG measures show 
      promise for predictive markers of brain stimulation treatment response. Future 
      focus on TMS-EEG measures may prove fruitful, given its ability to target 
      cortical regions of interest related to MDD.

TI  - The Therapeutic Potential of Non-Invasive and Invasive Cerebellar Stimulation 
      Techniques in Hereditary Ataxias.
LID - 10.3390/cells12081193 [doi]
LID - 1193
AB  - The degenerative ataxias comprise a heterogeneous group of inherited and acquired 
      disorders that are characterized by a progressive cerebellar syndrome, frequently 
      in combination with one or more extracerebellar signs. Specific disease-modifying 
      interventions are currently not available for many of these rare conditions, 
      which underscores the necessity of finding effective symptomatic therapies. 
      During the past five to ten years, an increasing number of randomized controlled 
      trials have been conducted examining the potential of different non-invasive 
      brain stimulation techniques to induce symptomatic improvement. In addition, a 
      few smaller studies have explored deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the dentate 
      nucleus as an invasive means to directly modulate cerebellar output, thereby 
      aiming to alleviate ataxia severity. In this paper, we comprehensively review the 
      clinical and neurophysiological effects of transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and 
      dentate nucleus DBS in patients with hereditary ataxias, as well as the presumed 
      underlying mechanisms at the cellular and network level and perspectives for 
      future research.

AB  - Deficits in synaptic transmission and plasticity are thought to contribute to the 
      pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several 
      brain stimulation techniques are currently available to assess or modulate human 
      neuroplasticity, which could offer clinically useful interventions as well as 
      quantitative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In this review, we discuss 
      several brain stimulation techniques, with a special emphasis on transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation (DBS), and review the results of 
      clinical studies that applied these techniques to examine or modulate impaired 
      neuroplasticity at the local and network levels in patients with AD or PD. The 
      impaired neuroplasticity can be detected in patients at the earlier and later 
      stages of both neurodegenerative diseases. However, current brain stimulation 
      techniques, with a notable exception of DBS for PD treatment, cannot serve as 
      adequate clinical tools to assist in the diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis of 
      individual patients with AD or PD. Targeting the impaired neuroplasticity with 
      improved brain stimulation techniques could offer a powerful novel approach for 
      the treatment of AD and PD.

AB  - The development of different methods of brain stimulation provides a promising 
      therapeutic tool with potentially beneficial effects on subjects with impaired 
      cognitive functions. We performed a systematic review of the studies published in 
      the field of neurostimulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), from basic research to 
      clinical applications. The main methods of non-invasive brain stimulation are 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current 
      stimulation. Preliminary findings have suggested that both techniques can enhance 
      performances on several cognitive functions impaired in AD. Another non-invasive 
      emerging neuromodulatory approach, the transcranial electromagnetic treatment, 
      was found to reverse cognitive impairment in AD transgenic mice and even improves 
      cognitive performance in normal mice. Experimental studies suggest that 
      high-frequency electromagnetic fields may be critically important in AD 
      prevention and treatment through their action at mitochondrial level. Finally, 
      the application of a widely known invasive technique, the deep brain stimulation 
      (DBS), has increasingly been considered as a therapeutic option also for patients 
      with AD; it has been demonstrated that DBS of fornix/hypothalamus and nucleus 
      basalis of Meynert might improve or at least stabilize cognitive functioning in 
      AD. Initial encouraging results provide support for continuing to investigate 
      non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation approaches as an adjuvant treatment 
      for AD patients.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common, severe neurodegenerative 
      brain disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques, 
      neurofibrillary tangles in the brain causing neural disintegration, synaptic 
      dysfunction, and neuronal death leading to dementia. Although many 
      US-FDA-approved drugs like Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine are available in 
      the market, their consumption reduces only the symptoms of the disease but fails 
      in potency to cure the disease. This disease affects many individuals with aging. 
      Combating the disease tends to be very expensive. This review focuses on 
      biochemical mechanisms in the neuron both at normal and AD state with relevance 
      to the tau hypothesis, amyloid hypothesis, the risk factors influencing dementia, 
      oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation altogether integrated with 
      neurodegeneration. A brief survey is carried out on available biomarkers in the 
      diagnosis of the disease, drugs used for the treatment, and the challenges in 
      approaching therapeutic targets in inhibiting the disease pathologies. This 
      review conjointly assesses the demerits with the inefficiency of drugs to reach 
      targets, their side effects, and toxicity. Optimistically, this review directs on 
      the advantageous strategies in using nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems 
      to cross the blood-brain barrier for improving the efficacy of drugs combined 
      with a novel neuronal stem cell therapy approach. Determinately, this review aims 
      at the natural, non-therapeutic healing impact of physical exercise on different 
      model organisms and the effect of safe neuromodulation treatments using 
      repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), transcranial Electrical 
      Stimulation (tES) in humans to control the disease pathologies prominent in 
      enhancing the synaptic function.

TI  - The interindividual variability of transcranial magnetic stimulation effects: 
      Implications for diagnostic use in movement disorders.
PG  - 936-949
LID - 10.1002/mds.27736 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A large number of methods have been described that use transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation to probe the physiology of the human motor cortex. Since the 
      1990s, hundreds of papers have used them to investigate neurophysiological 
      signatures of different types of movement disorders. However, in recent years 
      there has been increasing recognition of the interindividual variability of these 
      measures and a focus on estimating their reliability and reproducibility. 
      Although this work has been carried out in healthy individuals, it is highly 
      relevant to movement disorders because it may impact the validity of some 
      accepted ("canonical") neurophysiological biomarkers. The aim of this review is 
      to reexamine the diagnostic usefulness of transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      methods in movement disorders in the context of present knowledge of 
      methodological variability. METHODS: We conducted a search of the PubMed database 
      for research and review articles on transcranial magnetic stimulation and its 
      diagnostic utility in movement disorders (specifically Parkinson's disease and 
      atypical parkinsonism, dystonia, Tourette syndrome and other chronic tic 
      disorders, Huntington's disease, and essential tremor). We highlighted 
      contradictions in the literature and common misconceptions with the aim of 
      providing a clearer picture of the reliability of these measures in differential 
      diagnosis of movement disorders. CONCLUSION: Although there is no doubt that 
      these studies have provided useful insight into the pathophysiology of movement 
      disorders, there is a clear disagreement among many studies that questions the 
      validity of some of the so called "canonical" findings as diagnostic markers. 
      However, useful findings remain and even those with higher variability can be 
      used to support clinical diagnosis in selected cases. © 2019 International

AB  - In Parkinson's disease (PD), nigral degeneration determines an altered neuronal 
      ouput from the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, and as a consequence 
      functional changes in the motor circuits linking basal ganglia to the motor 
      cortical areas. Movement slowness, rigidity and tremor are among the principal 
      motor symptoms of PD. Studies of movement execution have shown that PD patients 
      have difficulty in performing simultaneous and sequential movements. In executing 
      sequential movements the abnormalities of PD patients worsen as the sequence 
      progresses. This phenomenon, called sequential effect, may be one of the 
      mechanisms underlying the fatigue of PD patients. Cortical deafferentation is 
      thought to be responsible for the motor disturbances of PD and studies using 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation showed that in PD patients there are 
      abnormalities in cortical plasticity and in cortical connectivity. Sensorimotor 
      integration refers to the processes that link sensory input to motor output to 
      produce appropriate voluntary movements. Sensory information is important for 
      motor preparation and execution in parkinsonian patients, and PD patients have 
      greater difficulty in performing movements when no external cues are provided. 
      Investigating the role of sensory information, several studies provided evidence 
      that PD patients have numerous somatosensory deficits, including tactile temporal 
      discrimination threshold. Neurophysiological testing in PD has also found altered 
      central somatosensory processing. Finally PD patients may experience painful 
      sensations after the onset of the disease and various evidence suggests an 
      abnormal nociceptive input processing in the central nervous system that might 
      predispose PD patients to developing pain.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Impulse control behaviours (ICBs) are a frequent comorbidity 
      for patients with Parkinson's disease. They consist of impulse control disorders, 
      dopamine dysregulation syndrome, and punding. The field continues to evolve in 
      the understanding of impulsivity and assessment of risk factors in the 
      development of these behaviours and their appropriate management in patients with 
      Parkinson's disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Impulsivity is a multifaceted concept that 
      is surprisingly common in untreated patients with Parkinson's disease. The 
      incidence of ICBs increases with demographic, clinical, and biochemical risk 
      factors. Treatments rely on reduction of dopamine agonists with exception of 
      cognitive behavioural therapy and possibly repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation. SUMMARY: Reduction of dopamine agonist dose is the mainstay of 
      treatment of ICBs. Other forms of dopaminergic treatment such as deep brain 
      stimulation or jejunal infusion are alternative treatments but may be complicated 
      by dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome. Other therapies show promise but data 
      are insufficient to suggest their regular use.

TI  - A narrative review on non-invasive stimulation of the cerebellum in neurological 
      diseases.
PG  - 2191-2209
LID - 10.1007/s10072-021-05187-1 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The cerebellum plays an important role in motor, cognitive, and 
      affective functions owing to its dense interconnections with basal ganglia and 
      cerebral cortex. This review aimed at summarizing the non-invasive cerebellar 
      stimulation (NICS) approaches used to modulate cerebellar output and treat 
      cerebellar dysfunction in the motor domain. OBSERVATION: The utility of NICS in 
      the treatment of cerebellar and non-cerebellar neurological diseases (including 
      Parkinson's disease, dementia, cerebellar ataxia, and stroke) is discussed. NICS 
      induces meaningful clinical effects from repeated sessions alone in both 
      cerebellar and non-cerebellar diseases. However, there are no conclusive data on 
      this issue and several concerns need to be still addressed before NICS could be 
      considered a valuable, standard therapeutic tool. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Even 
      though some challenges must be overcome to adopt NICS in a wider clinical 
      setting, this tool might become a useful strategy to help patients with lesions 
      in the cerebellum and cerebral areas that are connected with the cerebellum 
      whether one could enhance cerebellar activity with the intention of facilitating 
      the cerebellum and the entire, related network, rather than attempting to 
      facilitate a partially damaged cortical region or inhibiting the homologs' 
      contralateral area. The different outcome of each approach would depend on the 
      residual functional reserve of the cerebellum, which is confirmed as a critical 
      element to be probed preliminary in order to define the best patient-tailored 
      NICS.

AB  - In the last years, there has been a significant growth in the literature 
      exploiting transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with the aim at gaining 
      further insights into the electrophysiological and neurochemical basis underlying 
      vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Overall, TMS points at enhanced brain 
      cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity in VCI, especially in patients with 
      overt dementia, and neurophysiological changes seem to correlate with disease 
      process and progress. These findings have been interpreted as part of a 
      glutamate-mediated compensatory effect in response to vascular lesions. Although 
      a single TMS parameter owns low specificity, a panel of measures can support the 
      VCI diagnosis, predict progression, and possibly identify early markers of "brain 
      at risk" for future dementia, thus making VCI a potentially preventable cause of 
      both vascular and degenerative dementia in late life. Moreover, TMS can be also 
      exploited to select and evaluate the responders to specific drugs, as well as to 
      become an innovative rehabilitative tool in the attempt to restore impaired 
      neural plasticity. The present review provides a perspective of the different TMS 
      techniques by further understanding the cortical electrophysiology and the role 
      of distinctive neurotransmission pathways and networks involved in the 
      pathogenesis and pathophysiology of VCI and its subtypes.

AB  - Testing the effects of CNS active drugs (neurotransmitters, neuromodulators) on 
      motor cortical excitability by means of TMS has developed into an important field 
      of research. At least two major avenues can be followed up. First, testing a drug 
      with a known singular mode of action may provide information on the physiological 
      properties of a novel TMS measure. For instance, it was shown that the recently 
      discovered short latency afferent inhibition was significantly reduced by the 
      anticholinergic (M1 antagonist) scopolamine (Di Lazzaro et al., 2000b). This 
      opened up the opportunity to use short latency afferent inhibition (SLAI) to 
      detect deficiency of central cholinergic innervation in neurological disease, for 
      instance in Alzheimer's disease (Di Lazzaro et al., 2002). The other avenue is to 
      use an array of well characterised TMS measures to obtain knowledge about the 
      modes of action at the systems level of human cortex of a drug with unknown or 
      multiple modes of action. One example is the novel anticonvulsant topiramate for 
      which multiple modes of action were identified in animal experiments, including 
      blocking effects on voltage-gated sodium channels, positive modulation of the 
      GABAA receptor, inhibition of the kainate and AMPA subtypes of the glutamate 
      receptor, inhibition of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and increase of 
      cerebral GABA levels. Topiramate resulted in a selective increase of SICI and 
      decrease of ICF without affecting motor threshold or CSP (Reis et al., 2002). 
      From these results it was concluded that the main modes of action of topiramate 
      at the level of the human motor cortex are its enhancing action on GABAA 
      receptors and/or inhibition of glutamate receptors. TMS offers now a wide array 
      of measures of motor cortical excitability which covers many different forms of 
      excitability, such as axon and inhibitory and excitatory synaptic excitability. 
      Increasing numbers of different forms of cortical inhibition are being 
      discovered, such as SICI (GABAA dependent), CSP (GABAB dependent) and SLAI 
      (cholinergic), and it is very likely that more will follow soon.

LID - 906
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by progressive dysfunction 
      of the upper and lower motor neurons. The disease can evolve over time from focal 
      limb or bulbar onset to involvement of other regions. There is some clinical 
      heterogeneity in ALS with various phenotypes of the disease described, from 
      primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy and flail arm/leg 
      phenotypes. Whilst the majority of ALS patients are sporadic in nature, recent 
      advances have highlighted genetic forms of the disease. Given the close 
      relationship between ALS and frontotemporal dementia, the importance of cortical 
      dysfunction has gained prominence. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a 
      noninvasive neurophysiological tool to explore the function of the motor cortex 
      and thereby cortical excitability. In this review, we highlight the utility of 
      TMS and explore cortical excitability in ALS diagnosis, pathogenesis and insights 
      gained from genetic and variant forms of the disease.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can offer therapeutic benefits and 
      provide value in neurophysiological research. One of the newer TMS paradigms is 
      theta burst stimulation (TBS) which can be delivered in two patterns: continuous 
      (cTBS - inducing LTD-like effects) and intermittent (iTBS - inducing LTP-like 
      effects). This review paper aims to explore studies that have utilized TBS 
      protocols over different areas of the cortex to study the neurophysiological 
      functions and treatment of patients with schizophrenia. PubMed was searched using 
      the following keywords "schizophrenia", "schizoaffective", or "psychosis", and 
      "theta burst stimulation". Out of the 90 articles which were found, thirty met 
      review inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria included studying the reported 
      effect (clinical, physiological, or both) of at least one session of TBS on human 
      subjects, and abstracts (at minimum) must have been in English. The main target 
      areas included prefrontal cortex (12 studies - 10 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
      (DLPFC), 2 dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC)) vermal cerebellum (5), and 
      temporo-parietal cortex (8). Other target areas included inferior parietal lobe 
      (2), and motor cortex (3). TBS neurophysiological effect was explored in 5 
      studies using functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI), magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopy (MRS), electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG) and 
      positron emission topography (PET) scan. Overall, TBS can offer great therapeutic 
      potential as it is well-tolerated, feasible, and has few, if any, adverse 
      effects. TBS may be targeted to treat specific symptomatology, as an augmenting 
      intervention to pharmacotherapy, or even improving patient's insight into their 
      diagnosis.

TI  - TMS as a Tool for Examining Cognitive Processing.
PG  - 52
LID - 10.1007/s11910-015-0575-8 [doi]
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method where an 
      externally placed, rapidly changing magnetic field causes induction of weak 
      electric currents that lead to changes in neuronal polarization and activity. TMS 
      is a modality that has emerged as a unique tool in the study of functional 
      neuroscience for several reasons. TMS can be used to selectively activate or 
      inhibit specific cortical structures, leading to transient perturbations in their 
      function. Systematic study of these perturbations has been employed to determine 
      the function of specific cortical structures and to investigate 
      structure-function relationships. These studies extend to the functional mapping 
      of brain structures as well as brain networks. While TMS was first validated in 
      studies of motor cortex function, it has been applied to the study of cognition 
      and cognitive processing. "Virtual lesions" can be transiently induced in areas 
      of eloquent cortex that allow for the evaluation of their function in cognition 
      and behavior and can be used to evaluate the modes and hierarchy of control of 
      these functions. When TMS is delivered in a repetitive fashion, long-term 
      alterations of cortical function are induced which can be used to study 
      functional brain plasticity, and the changes in brain plasticity in different 
      cognitive states, including aging and diseases involving cognition. Furthermore, 
      repetitive TMS strategies have been developed as possible modulators of cognitive 
      function, with potential to serve as cognitive enhancers in both healthy and 
      disease states. In this review, specific attention is given to the use of TMS in 
      the evaluation of neurophysiologic changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well 
      as the potential role of TMS as a cognitive enhancing therapy in AD.

TI  - Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Gait and Freezing of 
      Gait in Parkinson Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

LID - S0003-9993(19)31004-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.apmr.2019.07.013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to systematically assess the 
      effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) intervention 
      on gait in individuals with Parkinson disease (PD). DATA SOURCES: We searched 
      online electronic databases up to March 28, 2019, including MEDLINE, Embase, the 
      Cochrane Library, and so on. STUDY SELECTION: The inclusion criteria for this 
      review were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), exploring the effect of rTMS in 
      patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction was 
      performed independently by 2 reviewers based on predefined criteria and the 
      methodologic quality of included studies was quantified by the Physiotherapy 
      Evidence Database scale. The outcome measure was walking performance, including 
      walking time (short term and long term), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and so on. 
      DATA SYNTHESIS: Among 14 eligible studies, including 298 participants (mean age ± 
      SD [y], 63.24±9.71; 191 [64%] men) were analyzed in this meta-analysis. Walking 
      time was improved with rTMS compared with sham rTMS (standardized mean difference 
      [SMD] -0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.57 to -0.03; P=.03). The score for 
      the freezing of gait questionnaire did not differ significantly between rTMS and 
      no intervention. Four studies compared TUG between the 2 treatment groups and no 
      significant differences were found between the rTMS and control group (SMD -0.45; 
      95% CI, -1.32 to 0.41; P=.30). During the off-state, there were no significant 
      differences in estimated effect sizes (SMD=-0.29; 95% CI, -0.79 to 0.21; P=.25), 
      which is significantly different in on-state (SMD -0.98; 95% CI, -1.78 to -0.18; 
      P=.02) evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the meta-analysis propose the 
      favorable effect of rTMS on walking performance in the short term but not over 
      the long term in individuals with PD.

TI  - Disease-Modifying Effects of Non-Invasive Electroceuticals on β-Amyloid Plaques

LID - 679
AB  - Electroceuticals refer to various forms of electronic neurostimulators used for 
      therapy. Interdisciplinary advances in medical engineering and science have led 
      to the development of the electroceutical approach, which involves therapeutic 
      agents that specifically target neural circuits, to realize precision therapy for 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date, extensive studies have attempted to elucidate 
      the disease-modifying effects of electroceuticals on areas in the brain of a 
      patient with AD by the use of various physical stimuli, including electric, 
      magnetic, and electromagnetic waves as well as ultrasound. Herein, we review 
      non-invasive stimulatory systems and their effects on β-amyloid plaques and tau 
      tangles, which are pathological molecular markers of AD. Therefore, this review 
      will aid in better understanding the recent technological developments, 
      applicable methods, and therapeutic effects of electronic stimulatory systems, 
      including transcranial direct current stimulation, 40-Hz gamma oscillations, 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, electromagnetic field stimulation, infrared 
      light stimulation and ionizing radiation therapy, and focused ultrasound for AD.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has served as an important technological 
      breakthrough in the field of the physiology of movement disorders over the last 
      three decades. TMS has grown popular owing to the ease of application as well as 
      its painless and noninvasive character. The technique has provide important 
      insights into understanding the pathophysiology of movement disorders, 
      particularly Parkinson's disease and dystonia. The basic applications have 
      included the study of motor cortex excitability, functioning of excitatory and 
      inhibitory circuits, study of interactions between sensory and motor systems, and 
      the plasticity response of the brain. TMS has also made important contributions 
      to understanding the response to treatments such as dopaminergic medications, 
      botulinum toxin injections, and deep brain stimulation surgery. This review 
      summarizes the knowledge gained to date with TMS in Parkinson's disease and 
      dystonia, and highlights the current challenges in the use of TMS technology.

AB  - Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a prevalent reversible 
      neurological disorder characterized by impaired locomotion, cognition and urinary 
      control with ventriculomegaly. Symptoms can be relieved with cerebrospinal fluid 
      drainage, which makes iNPH the leading cause of reversible dementia. Because of a 
      limited understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, unspecific symptoms and 
      the high prevalence of comorbidity (i.e. Alzheimer's disease), iNPH is largely 
      underdiagnosed. For these reasons, there is an urgent need for developing 
      noninvasive quantitative biomarkers for iNPH diagnosis and prognosis. Structural 
      and functional changes of brain circuits in relation to symptoms and treatment 
      response are expected to deliver major advances in this direction. We review 
      structural and functional brain connectivity findings in iNPH and complement 
      those findings with iNPH symptom meta-analyses in healthy populations. Our goal 
      is to reinforce our conceptualization of iNPH as to brain network mechanisms and 
      foster the development of new hypotheses for future research and treatment 
      options.

AB  - Central cholinergic circuits of human brain can be tested non-invasively by 
      coupling electrical peripheral stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS) of the motor cortex. The short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) is reduced 
      in cholinergic forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia 
      with Lewy bodies, while it is normal in non-cholinergic forms of dementia, such 
      as frontotemporal dementia. This finding suggests that this method can be used as 
      a non-invasive additional tool for discriminating between cholinergic and 
      non-cholinergic forms of dementia. Interestingly, SAI was also found to be 
      significantly smaller in early AD patients. Identification of SAI abnormalities 
      that occur early in the course of AD will allow earlier diagnosis and treatment 
      with cholinergic drugs. In patients with vascular dementia, SAI responses varied 
      widely; the number of patients with abnormal SAI conceivably reflects the 
      percentage of subjects with a significant cholinergic dysfunction. It has 
      recently been demonstrated that brain microbleeds have an impact on SAI that is 
      independent of the extent of associated white matter changes and ischemic stroke. 
      Since SAI can be increased by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, TMS may help in 
      identifying the patients who would be suitable for long-term treatment with 
      cholinergic agents.

PG  - 2120-4
AB  - Up to 40% of cases of Parkinson's disease are associated with the occurrence of 
      depression. The symptoms of the patients' depressive state may be factors such as 
      significant weight change, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor retardation, 
      fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, 
      decreased concentration and indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts of death or 
      suicidal ideation. Given these conditions, drugs prove ineffective in many cases. 
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been reported to be beneficial in cases of 
      drug-resistant depression. ECT has also been applied to Parkinsonian patients 
      with depression and found to be effective with both depression and the 
      Parkinsonian symptom. Transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS) has recently been 
      investigated for application in cases of depression and has become known as a 
      valuable tool for depression therapy. TMS is easily implemented even in 
      outpatient therapy. TMS will make a great contribution to the therapy of 
      depression with Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) based methods are emerging as a unique 
      approach to evaluate in real-time brain electrical activity in healthy and 
      pathological conditions. By applying TMS pulses in two different bran areas 
      within a short temporal frame of few milliseconds, it is possible to investigate 
      their physiological interactions. These paradigms, collectively termed dual-site 
      TMS, have been inspired by Professor John Rothwell's work, based on the idea that 
      applying a conditioning stimulus over a cortical area may activate putative 
      pathways projecting onto a second target area, thus providing a unique 
      opportunity to test the causal effects between interconnected brain areas. This 
      review highlights the most important features of dual-coil TMS protocols, mainly 
      pioneered in Professor John Rothwell's lab. In the first part, I reviewed 
      development of dual-site TMS protocols leading to the discovery of a distributed 
      system of short-latency interactions within the human parieto-frontal network, 
      likely mediated by direct anatomical pathways. In the second part, the 
      physiological role of these dual-site TMS evoked pathways is considered, 
      describing how these functional interactions are not fixed but vary depending on 
      the brain activation, the condition and on the precise time window in which they 
      are explored. Then, I reviewed recent advances showing that the repeated coupling 
      of interconnected neuronal populations, by means of dual-coil TMS, is able to 
      induce spike-time-dependent plasticity and to determine selective potentiation of 
      physiological connectivity between two human brain regions. Finally, the 
      therapeutic implications of these novel discoveries are discussed, pointing to 
      multi-site TMS as a novel tool to identify early features of synaptic 
      dysfunctions, to monitor disease progression and potentially to provide novel 
      therapeutic approaches by reshaping plasticity in different neurological and 
      psychiatric conditions.

AB  - The rapid methodological development and growing availability of neuromodulation 
      techniques have spurred myriad studies investigating their clinical 
      effectiveness. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has in many instances been proven to exert 
      antidepressant-like effects superior to placebo and equivalent to standard 
      psychopharmacological treatment. Due to the similar neuroanatomy and 
      neurophysiology of executive and affective control processes, rTMS to the DLPFC 
      may be able to address multiple issues simultaneously. This review pools 
      available literature on the therapeutic usage of rTMS on non-motor symptoms of 
      Parkinson's disease associated with the DLPFC (i.e. mood disturbance and 
      cognitive impairment). To the best of the author's knowledge, it is one of the 
      few available of its' kind, up to this date. Most studies included in the review 
      found beneficial effects of high frequency prefrontal rTMS on PD-related 
      depression. In regard to the usability of rTMS to alleviate cognitive impairment 
      associated with PD, definitive claims are yet to be established.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated that repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may have a beneficial effect in Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). Nevertheless, the clinical benefit of rTMS for AD remains inconclusive. 
      OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the 
      efficacy and safety of rTMS in AD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and 
      Cochrane for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rTMS for AD. We calculated 
      pooled estimates of mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The 
      protocol was registered at International Prospective Register of Systematic 
      Reviews (PROSPERO) (number CRD42018089990). RESULTS: Five RCTs involving 148 
      participants were included in this review. Compared with sham stimulation, 
      high-frequency rTMS led to a significant improvement in cognition as measured by 
      ADAS-cog (MD = -3.65, 95% CI -5.82 to -1.48, p = 0.001), but not MMSE (MD = 0.49, 
      95% CI -1.45 to 2.42, p = 0.62). High-frequency rTMS also improved the global 
      impression in comparison to the placebo (MD = -0.79, 95% CI -1.24 to -0.34, p = 
      0.0006). There was no significant difference in mood (MD = -1.36, 95% CI -3.93 to 
      1.21, p = 0.30) and functional performance (MD = 0.59, 95% CI -1.21 to 2.38, p = 
      0.52) between high-frequency rTMS and sham groups. Only one trial included 
      low-frequency rTMS reported no significant improvement in cognition, mood and 
      functional performance. Few mild adverse events were observed in both the rTMS 
      and sham groups. CONCLUSIONS: RTMS is relatively well tolerated, with some 
      promise for cognitive improvement and global impression in patients with AD. Our 
      findings also indicate the variability between ADAS-cog and MMSE in evaluating 
      global cognitive impairment.

      clinical trials and cohort studies, and studies with before-after designs were 
      considered for inclusion. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias and the National 
      Institutes of Health (NIH) tools to assess methodological quality. RESULTS: Out 
      of 258 records identified, 14 studies met our eligibility criteria (11 randomized 
      controlled trials (RCT) and 3 studies utilized before-and-after designs) with a 
      total of 418 patients (overall female-to-male ratio 1:1.17) included in the 
      review. The overall methodological quality of the included studies was assessed 
      to be fair to good. The stimulation parameters used varied considerably across 
      the studies. The summary findings of our review indicate the following 
      observations on the effects of rTMS on apathy: (1) the results of all included 
      studies in Alzheimer's disease investigating the effects of rTMS on apathy have 
      consistently shown a positive impact on apathy; (2) the majority of studies 
      conducted in Parkinson's disease have not found statistically significant 
      results; (3) a single study (RCT) on patients with primary progressive aphasia 
      demonstrated significant beneficial effects of rTMS on apathy; (4) the trials 
      conducted on individuals with MCI yielded varying conclusions; (5) one study 
      (RCT) in chronic stroke suggested that rTMS might have the potential to improve 
      apathy; (6) one study conducted on individuals with mild TBI did not find a 
      significant favorable association on apathy; and (7) the use of different rTMS 
      protocols on the populations described is generally safe. CONCLUSION: The 
      feasibility of utilizing rTMS as a treatment for apathy has been suggested in 
      this review. Overall, limited evidence suggests that rTMS intervention may have 
      the potential to modify apathy among patients with AD, PPA, MCI and chronic 
      stroke, but less so in PD and mild TBI. These findings require confirmation by 
      larger, well-designed clinical trials.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (rTMS) on motor recovery of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported; however, 
      the protocols of these studies varied greatly. The aim of this meta-analysis was 
      to evaluate the optimal rTMS parameters for motor recovery of PD. METHODS: 
      Electronic databases were searched for studies investigating the therapeutic 
      effects of rTMS on motor function in patients with PD. The section III of the 
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was extracted as the primary 
      outcome, and the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) was calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies with a total of 646 
      participants were included. The pooled estimates of rTMS revealed significant 
      short-term (SMD, 0.37; p < 0.00001) and long-term (SMD, 0.39; p = 0.005) effects 
      on motor function improvement of PD. Subgroup analysis observed that 
      high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) was significant in improving motor function (SMD, 
      0.48; p < 0.00001), but low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) was not. In particular, when 
      HF-rTMS targeted over the primary motor cortex (M1), in which the bilateral M1 
      revealed a larger effect size than unilateral M1. Compared to single-session, 
      multi-session of HF-rTMS over the M1 showed significant effect size. In addition, 
      HF-rTMS over the M1 with a total of 18,000-20,000 stimulation pulses yielded more 
      significant effects (SMD, 0.97; p = 0.01) than other dosages. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      conclusion, multi-session of HF-rTMS over the M1 (especially bilateral M1) with a 
      total of 18,000-20,000 pulses appears to be the optimal parameters for motor 
      improvement of PD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous neuromodulatory therapies are currently under investigation 
      or in clinical use for the treatment of psychiatric conditions. 
      OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: We sought to catalogue past and present human research 
      studies on psychiatric neuromodulation and identify relevant trends in this 
      field. METHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) and the 
      International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (https://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) 
      were queried in March 2020 for trials assessing the outcome of neuromodulation 
      for psychiatric disorders. Relevant trials were categorized by variables such as 
      neuromodulation modality, country, brain target, publication status, design, and 
      funding source. RESULTS: From 72,086 initial search results, 1252 unique trials 
      were identified. The number of trials registered annually has consistently 
      increased. Half of all trials were active and a quarter have translated to 
      publications. The largest proportion of trials involved depression (45%), 
      schizophrenia (18%), and substance use disorders (14%). Trials spanned 37 
      countries; China, the second largest contributor (13%) after the United States 
      (28%), has increased its output substantially in recent years. Over 75% of trials 
      involved non-convulsive non-invasive modalities (e.g., transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation), while convulsive (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy) and invasive 
      modalities (e.g., deep brain stimulation) were less represented. 72% of trials 
      featured approved or cleared interventions. Characteristic inter-modality 
      differences were observed with respect to enrollment size, trial design/phase, 
      and funding. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex accounted for over half of focal 
      neuromodulation trial targets. The proportion of trials examining biological 
      correlates of neuromodulation has increased. CONCLUSION(S): These results provide 
      a comprehensive overview of the state of psychiatric neuromodulation research, 
      revealing the growing scope and internationalism of this field.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects 
      of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on cognitive function in 
      older patients with cognitive impairment. METHODS: A literature search was 
      performed for articles published in English using the 10 databases (MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, PsycINFO, INSPEC, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
      Literature Plus, AMED, Biological Sciences, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic 
      Reviews) from their inception to May 2016. The primary outcome was cognitive 
      function as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination or the Alzheimer's 
      Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale. RESULTS: Seven RCTs were included in 
      the meta-analysis, with a sample of 107 active and 87 sham rTMS. Active rTMS was 
      found to be more effective in improving cognition (Hedges' g = 0.48; 95% 
      confidence interval 0.12 to 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency rTMS showed a 
      benefit on cognition amongst older patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's 
      disease. rTMS was shown to have great potential as a safe and well-tolerated 
      alternative intervention for cognition. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease and 
      a health challenge with major social and economic consequences. In this review, 
      we discuss the therapeutic potential of gamma stimulation in treating AD and 
      delve into the possible mechanisms responsible for its positive effects. Recent 
      studies reveal that it is feasible and safe to induce 40 Hz brain activity in AD 
      patients through a range of 40 Hz multisensory and noninvasive electrical or 
      magnetic stimulation methods. Although research into the clinical potential of 
      these interventions is still in its nascent stages, these studies suggest that 
      40 Hz stimulation can yield beneficial effects on brain function, disease 
      pathology, and cognitive function in individuals with AD. Specifically, we 
      discuss studies involving 40 Hz light, auditory, and vibrotactile stimulation, as 
      well as noninvasive techniques such as transcranial alternating current 
      stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The precise mechanisms 
      underpinning the beneficial effects of gamma stimulation in AD are not yet fully 
      elucidated, but preclinical studies have provided relevant insights. We discuss 
      preclinical evidence related to both neuronal and nonneuronal mechanisms that may 
      be involved, touching upon the relevance of interneurons, neuropeptides, and 
      specific synaptic mechanisms in translating gamma stimulation into widespread 
      neuronal activity within the brain. We also explore the roles of microglia, 
      astrocytes, and the vasculature in mediating the beneficial effects of gamma 
      stimulation on brain function. Lastly, we examine upcoming clinical trials and 
      contemplate the potential future applications of gamma stimulation in the 
      management of neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Neuroimaging-Guided Transcranial Magnetic and Direct Current Stimulation in MCI: 
      Toward an Individual, Effective and Disease-Modifying Treatment.
PG  - 82-90
LID - 10.1177/15500594211052815 [doi]
AB  - The therapeutic approaches currently applied in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
      similar neurodegenerative diseases are essentially based on pharmacological 
      strategies. However, despite intensive research, the effectiveness of these 
      treatments is limited to transient symptomatic effects, and they are still far 
      from exhibiting a true therapeutic effect capable of altering prognosis. The lack 
      of success of such pharmacotherapy-based protocols may be derived from the cases 
      in the majority of trials being too advanced to benefit significantly in 
      therapeutic terms at the clinical level. For neurodegenerative diseases, mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI) may be an early stage of the disease continuum, 
      including Alzheimer's. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have been 
      developed to modulate plasticity in the human cortex in the last few decades. 
      NIBS techniques have made it possible to obtain unique findings concerning brain 
      functions, and design novel approaches to treat various neurological and 
      psychiatric conditions. In addition, its synaptic and cellular neurobiological 
      effects, NIBS is an attractive treatment option in the early phases of 
      neurodegenerative diseases, such as MCI, with its beneficial modifying effects on 
      cellular neuroplasticity. However, there is still insufficient evidence about the 
      potential positive clinical effects of NIBS on MCI. Furthermore, the huge 
      variability of the clinical effects of NIBS limits its use. In this article, we 
      reviewed the combined approach of NIBS with various neuroimaging and 
      electrophysiological methods. Such methodologies may provide a new horizon to the 
      path for personalized treatment, including a more individualized pathophysiology 
      approach which might even define new specific targets for specific symptoms of 
      neurodegenerations.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a treatment option with 
      proved effectiveness especially in drug resist depression. It is used in 
      functional brain mapping before neurosurgery operations and diagnostic of 
      corticospinal tract transmission. Many studies are performed to evaluate rTMS 
      using in treatment of obsessive - compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, autism, 
      strokes, tinnitus, Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, cranial traumas. Moreover 
      rTMS was used in treatment of multiple sclerosis, migraine, dystonia. 
      Electromagnetical field generated by rTMS penetrate skin of the scalp and 
      infiltrate brain tissues to a depth of 2 cm, cause neurons depolarization and 
      generating motor, cognitive and affective effects. Depending on the stimulation 
      frequency rTMS can stimuli or inhibit brain cortex. rTMS mechanism of action 
      remains elusive. Probably it is connected with enhancement of neurotransmitters, 
      modulation of signals transductions pathways in Central Nervous System, gene 
      transcription and release of neuroprotective substances. Studies with use of 
      animals revealed that rTMS stimulation can generate brain changes similar to 
      those seen after electric shock therapy without provoking seizures. The aim of 
      presenting study was to analyze actual researches evaluating rTMS use in 
      treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for cognitive impairment in 
      Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - 791-801
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09644-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive 
      brain stimulation technique for Alzheimer's disease (AD). rTMS, with high- or 
      low-frequency, is thought to enhance or inhibit the cortical activities, 
      respectively. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to 
      summarize the efficacy of the rTMS on the cognition of AD patients and to 
      identify its potential influential factors. METHODS: Literature from the Pubmed, 
      Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched and screened to 
      identify eligible studies. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence 
      interval were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of rTMS. Subgroup analyses 
      were performed to investigate the influential factors. RESULTS: Ten studies with 
      15 trials involving 240 patients were included. Compared with sham stimulation, 
      rTMS could significantly improve cognition in AD (SMD, 0.42; 95% CI 0.18-0.67; 
      P = 0.0006). Subgroup analysis suggested significant cognitive enhancement in 
      participants receiving rTMS on multiple sites rather than on single site, and in 
      patients receiving rTMS of more than 10 sessions, but not ≤ 10 sessions. Compared 
      with rTMS as the single therapeutic method, rTMS with concurrent cognitive 
      training seemed to produce greater improvement. Moreover, 20 Hz rTMS, seemed to 
      be more effective than 10 Hz or 1 Hz rTMS. Furthermore, patients with higher 
      education, or with mild-to-moderate AD were more likely to benefit from rTMS than 
      patients with lower education, or with severe dementia, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current evidence, rTMS was an effective therapy for 
      cognitive impairment in AD. Large RCTs are warranted to further validate the 
      results of our subgroup analyses.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS): insights into the treatment 
      of Parkinson's disease by cortical stimulation.
PG  - 125-33
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a potent tool that can be 
      used to modify activity of targeted cortical areas. Significant clinical effects 
      have been obtained in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) by stimulating 
      different cortical regions with rTMS at inhibitory (low) or excitatory (high) 
      frequency. These effects were thought to result from plastic changes in motor 
      cortical networks. Actually cortical dysfunction has been documented in PD by 
      neuroimaging and neurophysiologic studies showing either hypo- or 
      hyper-activation of various brain areas. In addition, cortical excitability 
      studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation disclosed significant alterations 
      in intracortical facilitatory or inhibitory processes according to the resting 
      state or to phases of movement preparation or execution. These observations 
      clearly support the therapeutic potential of cortical neuromodulation in PD. 
      Motor cortex stimulation could impact on any station within the cortico-basal 
      ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops that are involved in motor control, providing 
      alleviation of parkinsonian symptoms. Depending on the target, cortical 
      stimulation might improve motor performance or other symptoms associated with PD, 
      like depression. Clinical application of rTMS to treat PD patients is limited by 
      the short duration of the effects beyond the time of stimulation, even if 
      long-lasting improvements have been observed after repeated rTMS sessions. In any 
      case, the place of cortical stimulation in the therapeutic management of PD 
      patients remains to be determined, as an alternative or a complementary technique 
      to deep brain stimulation. The rTMS technique could be used to better define the 
      targets and the parameters of stimulation subsequently applied in chronic 
      epidural stimulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to study the effect of precision repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left parietal cortex on the memory and 
      cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Based on the 
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, the left parietal cortex 
      site with the highest functional connectivity to the hippocampus was selected as 
      the target of rTMS treatment. Sixty-nine AD patients were randomized to either 
      rTMS or sham treatment (five sessions/week for a total of 10 sessions). The 
      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 12-Word Philadelphia Verbal Learning Test 
      (PVLT), and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) were assessed at baseline and after 
      the last session. RESULTS: After a 2-week treatment, compared to patients in the 
      sham group, those in the rTMS group scored significantly higher on PVLT total 
      score and its immediate recall subscale score. Moreover, in the rTMS group, there 
      were significant improvements after the 2-week treatment, which were manifested 
      in MMSE total score and its time orientation and recall subscale scores, as well 
      as PVLT total score and its immediate recall and short delay recall subscale 
      scores. In the sham group, the PVLT total score was significantly improved. 
      CONCLUSION: The target site of the left parietal cortex can improve AD patients' 
      cognitive function, especially memory, providing a potential therapy.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is emerging as a promising tool to 
      non-invasively assess specific cortical circuits in neurological diseases. A 
      number of studies have reported the abnormalities in TMS assays of cortical 
      function in dementias. A PubMed-based literature review on TMS studies targeting 
      primary and secondary dementia has been conducted using the key words 
      "transcranial magnetic stimulation" or "motor cortex excitability" and "dementia" 
      or "cognitive impairment" or "memory impairment" or "memory decline". Cortical 
      excitability is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in vascular dementia 
      (VaD), generally reduced in secondary dementias. Short-latency afferent 
      inhibition (SAI), a measure of central cholinergic circuitry, is normal in VaD 
      and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but suppressed in AD. In mild cognitive 
      impairment, abnormal SAI may predict the progression to AD. No change in cortical 
      excitability has been observed in FTD, in Parkinson's dementia and in dementia 
      with Lewy bodies. Short-interval intracortical inhibition and controlateral 
      silent period (cSP), two measures of gabaergic cortical inhibition, are abnormal 
      in most dementias associated with parkinsonian symptoms. Ipsilateral silent 
      period (iSP), which is dependent on integrity of the corpus callosum is abnormal 
      in AD. While single TMS measure owns low specificity, a panel of measures can 
      support the clinical diagnosis, predict progression and possibly identify earlier 
      the "brain at risk". In dementias, TMS can be also exploited to select and 
      evaluate the responders to specific drugs and, it might become a rehabilitative 
      tool, in the attempt to restore impaired brain plasticity.

      diagnosis.
PG  - 353-359
LID - 10.1097/WCO.0000000000001162 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Identification of upper motor neuron involvement remains a 
      critical component of a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
      although supportive clinical signs are often not easily appreciated, particularly 
      in the early symptomatic stages of the disease. Although diagnostic criteria have 
      been developed to facilitate improved detection of lower motor neuron impairment 
      through electrophysiological features that have improved diagnostic sensitivity, 
      assessment of upper motor neuron involvement remains problematic. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: Recent evidence has emerged about pathophysiological processes, 
      particularly glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, which has resulted in the 
      development of novel diagnostic investigations and uncovered potential 
      therapeutic targets. Advances in genetics, including the C9orf72 gene, have 
      changed concepts of ALS, from being classified as a neuromuscular disease to a 
      disease that forms a continuum with other primary neurodegenerative disorders, 
      particularly frontotemporal dementia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been 
      utilized to provide pathophysiological insights, leading to the development of 
      diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers, which are now being introduced into the 
      clinical setting. SUMMARY: Specifically, the advent of cortical hyperexcitability 
      has been consistently identified as an early and intrinsic feature of ALS. With 
      greater accessibility of TMS techniques promoting clinical utilization, TMS 
      measures of cortical function may develop as a diagnostic biomarker, with further 
      potential utility in the clinical trial setting for monitoring of neuroprotective 
      and genetic-based therapies.

AB  - Magnetic stimulation has called the attention of neuroscientists and the public 
      due to the possibility to stimulate and "control" the nervous system in a 
      non-invasive way. It has helped to make more accurate diagnosis, and apply more 
      effective treatments and rehabilitation protocols in several diseases that affect 
      the nervous system. Likewise, this novel tool has increased our knowledge about 
      complex neural behavior, its connections as well as its plastic modulation. 
      Magnetic stimulation applied in simple or paired-pulse protocols is a useful 
      alternative in the diagnosis of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson 
      disease, epilepsy, dystonia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebrovascular 
      disease, and sleep disorders. From the therapeutic perspective, magnetic 
      stimulation applied repetitively has been found useful, with different degrees of 
      efficacy, in treating resistant depression, tinnitus, psychogenic dysphonia, 
      Alzheimer disease, autism, Parkinson disease, dystonia, stroke, epilepsy, 
      generalized anxiety as well as post traumatic stress disorder, auditory 
      hallucinations, chronic pain, aphasias, obsessive-compulsive disorders, L-dopa 
      induced dyskynesia, mania and Rasmussen syndrome, among others. The potential of 
      magnetic stimulation in neurorehabilitation is outstanding, with excellent range 
      of safety and, in practical terms, without side effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noninvasive stimulation has been widely used in the past 30 years to 
      study and treat a large number of neurological diseases, including movement 
      disorders. OBJECTIVE: In this critical review, we illustrate the rationale for 
      use of these techniques in movement disorders and summarize the best medical 
      evidence based on the main clinical trials performed to date. METHODS: A 
      nationally representative group of experts performed a comprehensive review of 
      the literature in order to analyze the key clinical decision-making factors 
      driving transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS) in movement disorders. Classes of evidence and recommendations 
      were described for each disease. RESULTS: Despite unavoidable heterogeneities and 
      low effect size, TMS is likely to be effective for treating motor symptoms and 
      depression in Parkinson's disease (PD). The efficacy in other movement disorders 
      is unclear. TMS is possibly effective for focal hand dystonia, essential tremor 
      and cerebellar ataxia. Additionally, it is likely to be ineffective in reducing 
      tics in Tourette syndrome. Lastly, tDCS is likely to be effective in improving 
      gait in PD. CONCLUSIONS: There is encouraging evidence for the use of noninvasive 
      stimulation on a subset of symptoms in selected movement disorders, although the 
      means to optimize protocols for improving positive outcomes in routine clinical 
      practice remain undetermined. Similarly, the best stimulation paradigms and 
      responder profile need to be investigated in large clinical trials with 
      established therapeutic and assessment paradigms that could also allow genuine 
      long-term benefits to be determined.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative and progressive disease related 
      to a gradual decline in cognitive functions such as memory, attention, 
      perceptual-spatial abilities, language, and executive functions. Recent evidence 
      has suggested that interventions promoting neural plasticity can induce 
      significant cognitive gains especially in subjects at risk of or with mild AD. 
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS) are non-invasive techniques that can induce significant and 
      long-lasting changes in focal and non-focal neuroplasticity. In this review, we 
      present initial preliminary evidence that TMS and tDCS can enhance performance in 
      cognitive functions typically impaired in AD. Also, we reviewed the initial six 
      studies on AD that presented early findings showing cognitive gains such as in 
      recognition memory and language associated with TMS and tDCS treatment. In 
      addition, we showed that TMS has also been used to assess neuroplasticity changes 
      in AD supporting the notion that cortical excitability is changed in AD due to 
      the neurodegenerative process. Due to the safe profile, cost of these tools, and 
      initial clinical trials results, further studies are warranted in order to 
      replicate and extend the initial findings of rTMS and tDCS as cognitive enhancers 
      in AD. Further trials should explore different targets of stimulation along with 
      different paradigms of stimulation including combination with behavioural 
      interventions.

AB  - There is increasing evidence for the efficacy of neuromodulation in the treatment 
      of resistant mood disorders and emerging data supporting the use of 
      neuromodulation in cognitive disorders. A significant minority of depressed 
      elders do not respond to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy. This has led 
      clinicians to recommend the increasing use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in 
      the treatment of medication-resistant or life-threatening geriatric depression. 
      Multiple studies have supported the safety and efficacy of ECT in the elderly, 
      yet ECT is associated with side effects including cardiovascular and cognitive 
      side effects. Neuromodulation therapies have the potential for providing 
      effective treatment for treatment-resistant older adults with reduced side 
      effects and this review will outline the risks and benefits of neuromodulation 
      treatment in geriatric psychiatry. There is also emerging evidence of the 
      efficacy of neuromodulation devices in the treatment of cognitive disorders. 
      Pharmacotherapy has been largely ineffective in changing the course of 
      neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia and other treatments are clearly 
      needed. This review will outline the available evidence for neuromodulation in 
      the treatment of mood and cognitive disorders in the elderly.

AB  - Traditionally, Parkinson's disease (PD) has been considered a single 
      neurotransmitter (dopaminergic) disease. However, research over the past 20 years 
      has shed light on the involvement of multiple neurotransmission systems, in 
      particular, the cholinergic system. Research has mainly focused on the role of 
      this system in the pathophysiology of PD and its implications in the development 
      of motor and non-motor disorders. Short-latency sensory afferent inhibition 
      (SAI), investigates sensori-motor integration, and has emerged as a putative 
      neurophysiological marker of cholinergic function in the human brain. In this 
      quantitative review, a moderate-to-severe reduction in SAI was observed in PD 
      patients. Furthermore, through moderator analysis, the impairment of SAI was 
      shown to be associated with disease duration and therapeutic state. Patients 
      under dopaminergic agents ("on" state) displayed worse SAI than those after 
      dopaminergic agent withdrawal ("off"). We further assess the potential value of 
      SAI as a marker of cognitive impairment in PD, and its association with four 
      specific cognitive domains. This analysis revealed that patients with cognitive 
      impairment displayed significantly lower levels of SAI than those without 
      cognitive impairment. To conclude, a set of challenges to be addressed before SAI 
      can be validated as a useful clinical tool in PD are presented.

LID - 10.3233/RNN-2010-0557 [doi]
AB  - Since various studies, including multi-centre studies, investigating the effect 
      of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in depression have shown 
      different results, it is now important to research, which symptoms of depression 
      are most responsive to this kind of non-invasive brain stimulation. Furthermore, 
      an increasing interest of rTMS as a potential tool for treatment of neurological 
      and psychiatric disorders should be recorded. Therefore, it is critical to 
      investigate dopaminergic functional interactions in the prefrontal cortex, and in 
      particular, the effect of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation on clinical 
      symptoms depending on dopaminergic concentrations in various brain regions. This

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease with no existing 
      treatment leading to full recovery. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown 
      usually precedes the advent of first symptoms in AD and accompanies the 
      progression of the disease. At the same time deliberate BBB opening may be 
      beneficial for drug delivery in AD. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) 
      techniques, primarily transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial 
      direct current stimulation (tDCS), have shown multiple evidence of being able to 
      alleviate symptoms of AD. Currently, TMS/tDCS mechanisms are mostly investigated 
      in terms of their neuronal effects, while their possible non-neuronal effects, 
      including mitigation of the BBB disruption, are less studied. We argue that 
      studies of TMS/tDCS effects on the BBB in AD are necessary to boost the 
      effectiveness of neuromodulation in AD. Moreover, such studies are important 
      considering the safety issues of TMS/tDCS use in the advanced AD stages when the 
      BBB is usually dramatically deteriorated. Here, we elucidate the evidence of 
      NIBS-induced BBB opening and closing in various models from in vitro to humans, 
      and highlight its importance in AD.

AB  - This report reviews and compares all therapies that have shown efficacy in 
      depression and Parkinson's disease, although some are not in current use and 
      others are at the experimental stage. They include pharmacological modification 
      of neurotransmitter pathways, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), sleep deprivation, 
      psychosurgery, electrical stimulation through cerebral electrodes, and 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation. Stemming from a pathophysiological model that 
      stresses the brain as an open, complex, and nonlinear system, all therapies have 
      been attributed a common mechanism of action. This report suggests that the 
      therapeutic isomorphism is related to their ability to help the CNS deactivate 
      cortical-subcortical circuits that are dysfunctionally coupled. These circuits 
      are self-organized among neurons of their informational subsystem (rapid 
      conduction) and modulating subsystem (slow conduction). Finally, this report 
      extends the analysis and comparison of these therapies to some cardiac 
      arrhythmias.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) is a form of 
      dual-site transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) entailing a series of 
      single-TMS pulses paired at specific interstimulus intervals (ISI) delivered to 
      distant cortical areas. The goal of this article is to systematically review its 
      efficacy in inducing plasticity in humans focusing on stimulation parameters and 
      hypotheses of underlying neurophysiology. METHODS: A systematic review of the 
      literature from 2009-2023 was undertaken to identify all articles utilizing ccPAS 
      to study brain plasticity and connectivity. Six electronic databases were 
      searched and included. RESULTS: 32 studies were identified. The studies targeted 
      connections within the same hemisphere or between hemispheres. 28 ccPAS studies 
      were in healthy participants, 1 study in schizophrenia, and 1 in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) patients. 2 additional studies used cortico-cortical repetitive 
      paired associative stimulation (cc-rPAS) in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) 
      patients. Outcome measures include electromyography (EMG), behavioral measures, 
      electroencephalography (EEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 
      ccPAS seems to be able to modulate brain connectivity depending on the ISI. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ccPAS can be used to modulate corticospinal excitability, brain 
      activity, and behavior. Although the stimulation parameters used across studies 
      reviewed in this paper are varied, ccPAS is a promising approach for basic 
      research and potential clinical applications. SIGNIFICANCE: Recent advances in 
      neuroscience have caused a shift of interest from the study of single areas to a 
      more complex approach focusing on networks of areas that orchestrate brain 
      activity. Consequently, the TMS community is also witnessing a change, with a 
      growing interest in targeting multiple brain areas rather than a single locus, as 
      evidenced by an increasing number of papers using ccPAS. In light of this new 
      enthusiasm for brain connectivity, this review summarizes existing literature and 
      stimulation parameters that have proven effective in changing 
      electrophysiological, behavioral, or neuroimaging-derived measures.

AB  - It has long been acknowledged that memory changes over the course of one's life, 
      irrespective of diseases like dementia. Approaches to mitigate these changes have 
      however yielded mixed results. Brain stimulation has been identified as one novel 
      approach of augmenting older adult's memory. Thus far, such approaches have 
      however been nuanced, targeting different memory domains with different 
      methodologies. This has produced an amalgam of research with an unclear image 
      overall. This systematic review therefore aims to clarify this landscape, 
      evaluating, and interpreting available research findings in a coherent manner. A 
      systematic search of relevant literature was conducted across Medline, PsycInfo, 
      Psycarticles and the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, which 
      uncovered 44 studies employing non-invasive electrical brain stimulation in 
      healthy older adults. All studies were of generally good quality spanning 
      numerous memory domains. Within these, evidence was found for non-invasive brain 
      stimulation augmenting working, episodic, associative, semantic, and procedural 
      memory, with the first three domains having the greatest evidence base. Key sites 
      for stimulation included the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), 
      temporoparietal region, and primary motor cortex, with transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS) holding the greatest literature base. Inconsistencies 
      within the literature are highlighted and interpreted, however this discussion 
      was constrained by potential confounding variables within the literature, a risk 
      of bias, and challenges defining research aims and results. Non-invasive brain 
      stimulation often did however have a positive and predictable impact on older 
      adult's memory, and thus warrants further research to better understand these 
      effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a popular neurostimulation 
      technique suitable for the investigation of inhibitory and facilitatory networks 
      in the human motor system. In the last 20 years, several studies have used TMS to 
      investigate cortical excitability in various psychiatric disorders, leading to a 
      consequent improvement in pathophysiological understanding. However, little is 
      known about the overlap and specificity of these findings across these 
      conditions. OBJECTIVE: To provide a systematic review of TMS studies (1985-2013) 
      focusing on motor cortical excitability in dementia, schizophrenia, affective 
      disorders (major depression and bipolar), attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), 
      substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine) and other disorders 
      (borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)). METHODS: 
      Systematic literature-based review. RESULTS: Across disorders, patients displayed 
      a general pattern of cortical disinhibition, while the most consistent results of 
      reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition could be found in schizophrenia, 
      OCD and Tourette Syndrome. In dementia, the most frequently reported finding was 
      reduced short-latency afferent inhibition as a marker of cholinergic dysfunction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review indicate a general alteration 
      in motor cortical inhibition in mental illness, rather than disease-specific 
      changes. Changes in motor cortical excitability provide insight that can advance 
      understanding of the pathophysiology underlying various psychiatric disorders. 
      Further investigations are needed to improve the diagnostic application of these 
      parameters.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Improving Cognitive Function in 
      Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 593000

AB  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of Alzheimer's 
      disease. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been widely 
      employed in MCI research. However, there is no reliable systematic evidence 
      regarding the effects of rTMS on MCI. The aim of this review was to evaluate the 
      efficacy and safety of rTMS in the treatment of MCI. Methods: A comprehensive 
      literature search of nine electronic databases was performed to identify articles 
      published in English or Chinese before June 20, 2019. The identified articles 
      were screened, data were extracted, and the methodological quality of the 
      included trials was assessed. The meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 
      5.3 software. We used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence. 
      Results: Nine studies comprising 369 patients were included. The meta-analysis 
      showed that rTMS may significantly improve global cognitive function 
      (standardized mean difference [SMD] 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 
      3.24, p = 0.0004, seven studies, n = 296; low-quality evidence) and memory (SMD 
      0.44, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.72, p = 0.002, six studies, n = 204; moderate-quality 
      evidence). However, there was no significant improvement in executive function 
      and attention (p > 0.05). Subgroup analyses revealed the following: (1) rTMS 
      targeting the left hemisphere significantly enhanced global cognitive function, 
      while rTMS targeting the bilateral hemispheres significantly enhanced global 
      cognitive function and memory; (2) high-frequency rTMS significantly enhanced 
      global cognitive function and memory; and (3) a high number of treatments ≥20 
      times could improve global cognitive function and memory. There was no 
      significant difference in dropout rate (p > 0.05) between the rTMS and control 
      groups. However, patients who received rTMS had a higher rate of mild adverse 
      effects (risk ratio 2.03, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.52, p = 0.01, seven studies, n = 317; 
      moderate-quality evidence). Conclusions: rTMS appears to improve global cognitive 
      function and memory in patients with MCI and may have good acceptability and mild 
      adverse effects. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted cautiously due 
      to the relatively small number of trials, particularly for low-frequency rTMS.

AB  - Comforts in modern society have generally been associated with longer survival 
      rates, enabling individuals to reach advanced age as never before in history. 
      With the increase in longevity, however, the incidence of neurodegenerative 
      diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease, has also doubled. Nevertheless, most of 
      the observed variance, in terms of time of clinical diagnosis and progression, 
      often remains striking. Only recently, differences in the social, educational and 
      occupational background of the individual, as proxies of cognitive reserve (CR), 
      have been hypothesized to play a role in accounting for such discrepancies. CR is 
      a well-established concept in literature; lots of studies have been conducted in 
      trying to better understand its underlying neural substrates and associated 
      biomarkers, resulting in an incredible amount of data being produced. Here, we 
      aimed to summarize recent relevant published work addressing the issue, gathering 
      evidence for the existence of a common path across research efforts that might 
      ease future investigations by providing a general perspective on the actual state 
      of the arts. An innovative model is hereby proposed, addressing the role of CR 
      across structural and functional evidences, as well as the potential 
      implementation of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in the causal 
      validation of such theoretical frame.

TI  - Language Network Dysfunction and Formal Thought Disorder in Schizophrenia.
PG  - 486-497
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbac159 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathophysiological inquiries into schizophrenia require a 
      consideration of one of its most defining features: disorganization and 
      impoverishment in verbal behavior. This feature, often captured using the term 
      Formal Thought Disorder (FTD), still remains to be one of the most poorly 
      understood and understudied dimensions of schizophrenia. In particular, the 
      large-scale network level dysfunction that contributes to FTD remains obscure to 
      date. STUDY DESIGN: In this narrative review, we consider the various challenges 
      that need to be addressed for us to move towards mapping FTD (construct) to a 
      brain network level account (circuit). STUDY RESULTS: The construct-to-circuit 
      mapping goal is now becoming more plausible than it ever was, given the parallel 
      advent of brain stimulation and the tools providing objective readouts of human 
      speech. Notwithstanding this, several challenges remain to be overcome before we 
      can decisively map the neural basis of FTD. We highlight the need for phenotype 
      refinement, robust experimental designs, informed analytical choices, and present 
      plausible targets in and beyond the Language Network for brain stimulation 
      studies in FTD. CONCLUSIONS: Developing a therapeutically beneficial 
      pathophysiological model of FTD is a challenging endeavor, but holds the promise 
      of improving interpersonal communication and reducing social disability in 
      schizophrenia. Addressing the issues raised in this review will be a decisive 
      step in this direction.

      right for prime time?
PG  - 129-135
LID - 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000686 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neurocognitive disorders are associated with tremendous burden 
      at the level of the individual, the care giver, and society at large. No 
      effective treatments have been discovered to date. RECENT FINDINGS: Noninvasive 
      brain stimulation (NIBS) comprises several promising interventions that have been 
      studied in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Most recent studies have 
      tested transcranial direct current stimulation or repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation on their own or in combination with other interventions, 
      particularly cognitive training. While most studies were proof-of-principle 
      studies with small sample sizes, combination and long-duration protocols seem to 
      be promising approaches to pursue. Some studies also investigated novel 
      neurophysiological markers as predictors of response to NIBS. SUMMARY: NIBS 
      presents several interventional options that are ready to be evaluated using well 
      powered, long-duration trials. These future studies should build on the promising 
      leads from the current literature, including the potential advantage of combining 
      NIBS with other interventions; the delivery of interventions for long durations 
      to assess long-term impact; and the use of neurophysiological markers that could 
      optimize the personalization and efficacy of NIBS.

AB  - The field of dementia research has witnessed significant developments in our 
      understanding of neurodegenerative disorders, with a particular focus on 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Dementia, a 
      collection of symptoms arising from the degeneration of brain cells, presents a 
      significant healthcare challenge, especially as its prevalence escalates with 
      age. This abstract delves into the complexities of these disorders, the role of 
      biomarkers in their diagnosis and monitoring, as well as emerging 
      neurophysiological insights. In the context of AD, anti-amyloid therapy has 
      gained prominence, aiming to reduce the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques 
      in the brain, a hallmark of the disease. Notably, Leqembi recently received full 
      FDA approval, marking a significant breakthrough in AD treatment. Additionally, 
      ongoing phase 3 clinical trials are investigating novel therapies, including 
      Masitinib and NE3107, focusing on cognitive and functional improvements in AD 
      patients. In the realm of FTD, research has unveiled distinct neuropathological 
      features, including the involvement of proteins like TDP-43 and progranulin, 
      providing valuable insights into the diagnosis and management of this 
      heterogeneous condition. Biomarkers, including neurofilaments and various tau 
      fragments, have shown promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. 
      Neurophysiological techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), 
      have contributed to our understanding of AD and FTD. TMS has uncovered unique 
      neurophysiological signatures, highlighting impaired plasticity, 
      hyperexcitability, and altered connectivity in AD, while FTD displays differences 
      in neurotransmitter systems, particularly GABAergic and glutamatergic circuits. 
      Lastly, ongoing clinical trials in anti-amyloid therapy for AD, such as 
      Simufilam, Solanezumab, Gantenerumab, and Remternetug, offer hope for individuals 
      affected by this devastating disease, with the potential to alter the course of 
      cognitive decline. These advancements collectively illuminate the evolving 
      landscape of dementia research and the pursuit of effective treatments for these 
      challenging conditions.

PG  - III47-50
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used as a potential 
      therapeutic tool in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. We reviewed 
      the effects of rTMS as a treatment of Parkinson disease in this paper. The 
      existing reports have been conflicting regarding the efficacy of the rTMS in PD. 
      The controversy arises from the differences of the stimulation parameters and 
      evaluation methods of the effects in those studies. Furthermore, placebo effects 
      are common in trials of therapy for PD. The Japanese multi-center, double 
      blinded, sham stimulation controlled trial showed an efficacy in both the 
      rTMS-treated and control patients. The stimulation parameters used in this trial 
      showed some efficacy; however, the degree of the effects were not significantly 
      different from randomized, controlled patients. The result does not prove the 
      efficacy of the rTMS; on the other hand, it does not rule out the efficacy. 
      Further trials are necessary to reveal the therapeutic effect of rTMS in PD. 
      Further studies should be performed aiming to reveal the optimal stimulation 
      parameters.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a frustrating condition characterized by motor and 
      nonmotor deficits majorly caused by the loss of dopaminergic cells in the 
      Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc) and destruction of the nigrostriatal 
      pathway. Despite the very respectable advances in cutting-edge approaches for the 
      treatment of PD, there exist numerous challenges that have incapacitated the 
      definitive treatment of this disease. This review emphasized the development of 
      various non-pharmaceutical therapeutic approaches and mainly highlighted the 
      cutting-edge treatments for PD including gene- and stem cell-based therapies, 
      targeted delivery of neurotrophic factors, and brain stimulation techniques such 
      as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), transcranial Direct Current 
      Stimulation (tDCS), and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). The review covered various 
      gene therapy strategies including Adeno-Associated Virus-Glutamic Acid 
      Decarboxylase (AAV-GAD), AAV-Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AAV-AADC), 
      Lenti-AADC/Tyrosine Hydroxylase/Guanosine Triphosphate- Cyclohydrolase I 
      (Lenti-AADC/TH/GTP-CH1), AAV-Neurturin (AAV-NRTN), α-Synuclein silencing, and 
      PRKN gene delivery. Also, the advantages, disadvantages, and the results of 
      trials of these methods were discussed. Finally, reasons for the failure of PD 
      treatment were described, with the hopes separated from hypes.

TI  - Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Naming 
      of Elderly with Primary Progressive Aphasia.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17031095 [doi]
LID - 1095
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to conduct a qualitative evaluation by synthesizing 
      previous studies on the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) 
      on primary progressive aphasia (PPA)'s naming ability and prove the effects of 
      tDCS mediation on PPA naming using meta-analysis. Methods: This study searched 
      literature published from January 2000 to July 2019 using four academic databases 
      (i.e., PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library). The final seven 
      publications were systematically evaluated and meta-analysis was conducted for 
      two papers. The effect size was estimated by a standard mean difference (SMD) 
      using Hedge's g, and the significance of effect size was confirmed using the 95% 
      confidence interval. Results: The results of seven previous studies' quality 
      assessments ranged from 15 to 26, which were rated above adequate. The results of 
      the meta-analysis showed that the effect size was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.16-1.47), which 
      was a significant 'large effect'. Conclusions: This meta-analysis proved that 
      tDCS intervention significantly improved the naming performance of PPA. Future 
      studies must confirm the effects of tDCS on naming intervention by using 
      meta-analysis including many RCT studies.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of 
      depression in Parkinson disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      clinical trials.
PG  - 1751-61
LID - 10.1007/s10072-015-2345-4 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of depression in 
      patients with Parkinson disease in order to arrive at qualitative and 
      quantitative conclusions about the efficacy of rTMS. We included randomized 
      controlled trials examining the effects of rTMS compared with sham-rTMS or 
      selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The quality of included studies 
      was strictly evaluated. Data analyses were performed using the RevMan5.1 
      software. Eight studies including 312 patients met all inclusion criteria. The 
      results showed that rTMS could evidently improve the HRSD score compared with 
      sham-rTMS (p < 0.00001). However, we found similar antidepressant efficacy 
      between rTMS and SSRIs groups in terms of HRSD and BDI score (p = 0.65; p = 0.75, 
      respectively). Furthermore, patients who received rTMS could evidently show 
      improvement on the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS), ADL score, 
      and UPDRS motor score compared with sham-rTMS or SSRIs (p < 0.05, p = 0.05, 
      respectively). The subgroup analysis by frequency of rTMS evidenced that the 
      efficacy of low-frequency rTMS was superior to sham-rTMS (p < 0.0001) in terms of 
      the outcome measure according to HAMD scale. Meanwhile, the high-frequency rTMS 
      has the same antidepressant efficacy as SSRIs (p = 0.94). The current 
      meta-analysis provided evidence that rTMS was superior to sham-rTMS and had 
      similar antidepressant efficacy as SSRIs, and may have the additional advantage 
      of some improvement in motor function.

TI  - Treatment of Parkinson's disease by cortical stimulation.
PG  - 1755-71
LID - 10.1586/ern.09.132 [doi]
AB  - Opportunities for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) by cortical 
      stimulation are open. This review outlines the main arguments for the use of 
      cortical stimulation in PD: the widespread cortical dysfunction that could be 
      corrected by cortical stimulation; the main mechanism of action of subthalamic 
      nucleus stimulation that could take place within the primary motor cortex; and 
      the ability of cortical stimulation to modulate basal ganglia activity by 
      exciting cortico-basal ganglia projections. Such neuromodulatory effects could 
      correspond to either stimulus-locked changes in brain rhythms or delayed changes 
      in synaptic plasticity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can produce 
      transient improvement of motor performance when the primary motor cortex or the 
      supplementary motor area is targeted. Alleviation of mood and cognitive disorders 
      are rather observed when repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is applied 
      to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, to produce more permanent 
      therapeutic effects, chronic stimulation using surgically implanted electrodes is 
      necessary. For this purpose, epidural implantation is safer and should be used in 
      preference to subdural implantation. Pioneering results of epidural motor cortex 
      stimulation in PD have been published, but they relate to case reports and open 
      studies, precluding any definitive conclusion. Epidural cortical stimulation is 
      easy to perform and could be a valuable therapeutic alternative to deep-brain 
      stimulation. However, new epidural leads need to be designed before considering 
      the development of such a technique for PD treatment.

      of disease, and offered new therapeutic targets. MRI and positron emission 
      tomography have shown that neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal 
      dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) 
      are associated with changes in brain networks. However, the underlying 
      neurophysiological pathways driving pathological processes are poorly defined. 
      The gap between what imaging can discern and underlying pathophysiology can now 
      be addressed by advanced techniques that explore the cortical neural 
      synchronisation, excitability and functional connectivity that underpin 
      cognitive, motor, sensory and other functions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      can show changes in focal excitability in cortical and transcortical motor 
      circuits, while electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography can now record 
      cortical neural synchronisation and connectivity with good temporal and spatial 
      resolution.Here we reflect on the most promising new approaches to measuring 
      network disruption in AD, LBD, PD, FTD, MS, and ALS. We consider the most 
      groundbreaking and clinically promising studies in this field. We outline the 
      limitations of these techniques and how they can be tackled and discuss how these 
      novel approaches can assist in clinical trials by predicting and monitoring 
      progression of neurophysiological changes underpinning clinical symptomatology.

TI  - Neurobiology of placebo effect in Parkinson's disease: What we have learned and 
      where we are going.
PG  - 1213-1227

AB  - The placebo effect is a phenomenon produced when an inert substance administered 
      like a regular treatment improves the clinical outcome. Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      is one of the main clinical disorders for which the placebo response rates are 
      high. The first evidence of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the placebo 
      effect in PD stems from 2001, when de la Fuente-Fernandez and colleagues 
      demonstrated that a placebo injection led to the release of dopamine in the 
      striatal nuclei of PD measured with positron emission tomography technology. 
      Since then, several studies have been conducted to investigate the 
      neurobiological underpinnings of placebo responses. This article presents a 
      systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
      and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Of an initial yield of 143 papers, 19 were 
      included. The lessons learned from these studies are threefold: (i) motor 
      improvement is dependent on the activation of the entire nigrostriatal pathway 
      induced by dopamine release in the dorsal striatum; (ii) the magnitude of 
      placebo-induced effects is modulated by an expectancy of improvement, which is in 
      turn related to the release of dopamine within the ventral striatum; (iii) the 
      functioning of the neural pathways underlying the placebo response can be tuned 
      by prior exposure and learning strategies. In conclusion, although the neural 
      network underlying the placebo effect in PD has been largely confirmed and 
      accepted, what remains to be established is how, when, and where the expectation 
      of reward (mediated by the ventral striatum) interacts with the primary motor 
      system (mediated by the dorsal striatum) to induce clinical improvement in motor 
      symptoms. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

TI  - Is rTMS an effective therapeutic strategy that can be used to treat Parkinson's 
      disease?
PG  - 693-702
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive procedure 
      whereby a pulsed magnetic field stimulates electrical activity in the brain. 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative process characterized by numerous 
      motor and nonmotor clinical manifestations for which effective, mechanism-based 
      treatments remain elusive. Consequently, more advanced non-invasive therapeutic 
      methods are required. A possible method of rehabilitation that may be effective 
      and potentially viable for use in clinical practice is rTMS. Here, we focus on 
      the basic foundation of rTMS, the main findings of rTMS from animal models, the 
      effects of rTMS on sensorimotor integration in patients with PD, and the 
      experimental advances of rTMS that may become a viable clinical application to 
      treat the disease.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) fails to improve cognition in 
      patients with parkinson's disease: a Meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials.
PG  - 269-282
LID - 10.1080/00207454.2020.1809394 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline is one of the greatest concerns for patients with 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and their care partners. Repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a nonpharmacological treatment option used to 
      improve cognitive function in PD, but its efficacy is unclear. We performed a 
      meta-analysis to determine whether rTMS improves cognition in PD patients. 
      METHODS: Eligibility criteria (PICOS) were as follows: (1) 'P': The patients 
      participating were diagnosed with idiopathic PD; (2) 'I': Intervention using 
      rTMS; (3) 'C': Sham stimulation as control; (4) 'O': The outcome of the study 
      included cognitive evaluations; (5) 'S': The study adopted randomized controlled 
      design. The standardized mean difference (SMD) of change of score was applied to 
      measure efficacy, and we used Version 2 of the Cochrane tool to assess risk of 
      bias. RESULTS: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Compared with 
      sham-controlled group, the pooled result showed a non-significant short-term 
      effect of rTMS on global cognition (SMD: -0.15, 95% CI: -0.59 to 0.29, I(2) = 
      36.7%), executive function (SMD: 0.03, 95% CI: -0.21 to 0.26, I(2) = 0.0%), and 
      attention and working memory (SMD: 0.05, 95% CI: -0.25 to 0.35, I(2) = 0.0%). 
      Long-term outcomes were either shown to be statistically nonsignificant. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on a limited number of studies, rTMS fails to improve 
      cognition in PD. We call for additional high-quality randomized controlled trials 
      with adequate sample sizes to determine the efficacy of rTMS.

TI  - Non-invasive brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and

PG  - 1614-23
AB  - A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to quantify the efficacy of 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for 
      the treatment of motor dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
      Prospective studies which evaluated the effects of either TMS (12 studies) or ECT 
      (five studies) on motor function in PD using the motor subscale of the Unified 
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) for TMS studies and any continuous 
      measures of motor function in PD for ECT studies were included. The pooled effect 
      size (standardised mean difference between pre-treatment versus post-treatment 
      means) from a random effects model was 0.62 (95% confidence interval: 0.38, 0.85) 
      for TMS treatment and 1.68 (0.79, 2.56) for ECT treatment, and from a fixed 
      effects model was 0.59 (0.39, 0.78) for TMS treatment and 1.55 (1.07, 2.03) for 
      ECT treatment. TMS, across applied stimulation sites and parameters, can exert a 
      significant, albeit modest, positive effect on the motor function of patients 
      with PD. ECT also may exert a significant effect on motor function in PD 
      patients.

      efficacy of the NIBS techniques in PD. METHODS: We carried out an electronic 
      search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PEDro and PsycINFO (accessed 
      via Ovid) for articles published until August 2022. The treatment efficacy of 
      motor function was quantified by the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale 
      part III. RESULTS: 28 randomized controlled trials with parallel group were 
      included in the analysis, enrolling 1057 patients. In the "on" state, 
      high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HFrTMS) conferred 
      better short-term and long-term efficacy compared to transcranial direct current 
      stimulation. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve rank showed that HFrTMS 
      combined with transcranial direct current stimulation and low-frequency TMS 
      ranked first among PD in improving motor function. In the "off" state, there were 
      no significant differences in most of the treatments, but surface under the 
      cumulative ranking curve rank showed that continuous theta burst stimulation and 
      low-frequency TMS had the highest short- and long-term effect in improving motor 
      function. CONCLUSION: HFrTMS is an effective intervention in improving motor 
      function. Besides, its combination with another NIBS technique produces better 
      therapeutic effects in the "on" state.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by 
      motor and nonmotor symptoms (NMS). Several subsequent studies substantiate the 
      great functional burden related to NMS, their progression, and negative effect on 
      quality of life in PD. Additional evidence indicates interesting relationships 
      between striatal dopaminergic function and NMS. The basal ganglia are implicated 
      in the modulation and integration of sensory information and pain, bladder 
      function is under control of both inhibitory (D1) and facilitatory (D2) 
      dopaminergic inputs, finally reduced dopaminergic activity in the mesocortical 
      and mesolimbic pathways is involved in the development of several NMS including 
      mood, motivational, and cognitive alterations. Some NMS fluctuate in response to 
      dopaminergic treatment and are relieved by dopamine replacement therapy, other 
      are insensitive to current therapeutic strategies. The relation among the overall 
      disease complications, perhaps the most important for PD patients and family 
      members' well-being and functionality is dementia that affects most PD patients 
      over the course of disease. Specific pharmacological treatment is lacking, and 
      alternative approaches have been implemented to improve everyday functionality 
      and quality of life. The state of the art suggests that cognitive rehabilitation 
      in PD is possible and may either increase performance or preserve cognitive level 
      over the time. However, it is also evident that cognitive abnormalities in PD are 
      heterogeneous and we still do not have biomarkers to detect early patients at 
      risk for dementia. Cognitive dysfunction is one the most prevalent NMS and is a 
      clinically and functionally important disease milestone. Given the available 
      clinical and imaging evidence it is possible to use cognition to model NMS 
      progression and design nonpharmacological interventions. In this chapter we will 
      address the use of cognitive rehabilitation and noninvasive brain stimulation 
      techniques to modulate cognitive performance and rescue connectivity in affected 
      brain circuitry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) may be beneficial in ameliorating cognitive deficits in 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: AD patients received four high-frequency rTMS 
      sessions over the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) over two 
      weeks. Structured cognitive assessments were administered at baseline, at 2 weeks 
      after completion of rTMS, and at 4 weeks post treatment. At these same times, 
      tolerant patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while 
      performing structured motor and cognitive tasks. We also reviewed literature 
      regarding the effects of rTMS on cognitive function in AD. RESULTS: A total of 12 
      patients were enrolled, eight of whom tolerated the fMRI. Improvement was seen in 
      Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination tests of verbal and non-verbal agility 4 
      weeks post-treatment. The fMRI analysis showed trends for increased activation 
      during cognitive performance tasks immediately after and at 4 weeks 
      post-treatment. Our literature review revealed several double-blind, 
      sham-controlled studies, all showing sustained improvement in cognition of AD 
      patients with rTMS. CONCLUSIONS: There was improvement in aspects of language 
      after four rTMS treatments, sustained a month after treatment cessation. Our 
      results are consistent with other studies and standardization of treatment 
      protocols using functional imaging may be of benefit.

AB  - Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a new technique for the 
      modulation of oscillatory brain activity as measured in the electroencephalogram 
      (EEG). In contrast to well-established stimulation techniques, such as 
      transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, 
      tACS applies a sinusoidal alternating current at a specific frequency. This 
      enables the modulation of the amplitude and frequency of endogenous brain 
      oscillations as well as related cognitive processes. Therefore, the use of tACS 
      has the possibility to evaluate well-known correlations between brain 
      oscillations and cognitive processes in terms of causality. Such causal 
      relationships have been documented in numerous neurocognitive studies on sensory, 
      motor and perceptual processes; however, the clinical application of tACS is 
      still in its infancy. In principle, any pathology that can reliably be connected 
      with brain oscillations of a defined frequency is treatable. A current main focus 
      of clinical research is on symptoms of Parkinson's disease and to a lesser 
      degree, tinnitus. For an effective application of tACS it is important to choose 
      the electrode positions as well as the frequency, intensity and duration of the 
      stimulation in a theory-based and symptom-related manner. A successful 
      therapeutic intervention requires the persistence of the tACS effect after 
      stimulation has ceased. A mechanism that offers not only an explanation to the 
      origin of persistent tACS effects but is also of high therapeutic benefit is 
      neural plasticity. Therefore, one current focus of research aims at a better 
      understanding of tACS after effects.

TI  - The role of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment 
      of cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review 
      and meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been 
      considered a potentially effective treatment for cognitive impairment in patients 
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD), previous studies have produced inconsistent 
      results. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of rTMS 
      on cognitive function in patients with AD. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of 
      Science, MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 
      were searched for relevant terms. Abstracts of all papers were carefully 
      reviewed, followed by data extraction, quality assessment, data synthesis and 
      subgroup analyses. RESULT: A total of 12 studies with 231 patients were included, 
      with 8 randomized controlled studies and 4 self-controlled studies. Eleven 
      studies used high frequency rTMS (≥ 5 Hz), but only one study directly compared 
      the difference between low-frequency (1 Hz) and high-frequency (20 Hz). 
      Random-effects analysis revealed that rTMS could significantly improve cognition 
      compared with sham-rTMS (SMD: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.35-0.85, P < .0001). In subgroup 
      analyses, the effect for stimulation at a single target was 0.13 (95% CI: 
      -0.35-0.62) and multiple targets 0.86 (95% CI: 0.18-1.54). Treatment for ≤3 
      sessions produced an effect of 0.29 (95% CI: -1.04-1.62), whereas treatment for 
      ≥5 sessions produced an effect of 2.77 (95% CI: 2.22-3.32). No differences were 
      found for rTMS combined with medication or cognitive training. CONCLUSIONS: rTMS 
      can significantly improve cognitive ability in patients with mild to moderate AD. 
      Stimulation of multiple sites and long-term treatment are better at improving 
      AD-associated cognitive performance. Furthermore, some novel interventional 
      targets, like precuneus (PC), may be a more effective therapeutic site to improve 
      memory in AD.

AB  - Cognitive impairment is a core symptom of many neuropsychiatric diseases and a 
      key contributor to the patient's quality of life. However, an effective 
      therapeutic strategy has yet to be developed. Noninvasive brain stimulation 
      techniques, namely transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial 
      direct current stimulation (tDCS), are promising techniques that are under 
      investigation for a variety of otherwise treatment-resistant neuropsychiatric 
      diseases. Notably, these tools can induce alterations in neural networks 
      subserving cognitive operations and thus may provide a means for cognitive 
      restoration. The purpose of this article is to review the available evidence 
      concerning cognitive enhancing properties of noninvasive brain stimulation in 
      neuropsychiatry. We specifically focus on major depression, Alzheimer's disease, 
      schizophrenia, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), where

AB  - This review examines the involvement of the motor cortex in Parkinson's disease 
      (PD), a debilitating movement disorder typified by degeneration of dopamine cells 
      of the substantia nigra. While much of PD research has focused on the 
      caudate/putamen, many aspects of motor cortex function are abnormal in PD 
      patients and in animal models of PD, implicating motor cortex involvement in 
      disease symptoms and their treatment. Herein, we discuss several lines of 
      evidence to support this hypothesis. Dopamine depletion alters regional 
      metabolism in the motor cortex and also reduces interneuron activity, causing a 
      breakdown in intracortical inhibition. This leads to functional reorganization of 
      motor maps and excessive corticostriatal synchrony when movement is initiated. 
      Recent work suggests that electrical stimulation of the motor cortex provides a 
      clinical benefit for PD patients. Based on extant research, we identify a number 
      of unanswered questions regarding the motor cortex in PD and argue that a better 
      understanding of the contribution of the motor cortex to PD symptoms will 
      facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a widely-used tool to induce 
      neuroplasticity and modulate cortical function by applying weak direct current 
      over the scalp. In this review, we first introduce the underlying mechanism of 
      action, the brief history from discovery to clinical scientific research, 
      electrode positioning and montages, and parameter setup of tDCS. Then, we review 
      tDCS application in clinical samples including people with drug addiction, major 
      depression disorder, Alzheimer's disease, as well as in children. This review 
      covers the typical characteristics and the underlying neural mechanisms of tDCS 
      treatment in such studies. This is followed by a discussion of safety, especially 
      when the current intensity is increased or the stimulation duration is prolonged. 
      Given such concerns, we provide detailed suggestions regarding safety procedures 
      for tDCS operation. Lastly, future research directions are discussed. They 
      include foci on the development of multi-tech combination with tDCS such as with 
      TMS and fMRI; long-term behavioral and morphological changes; possible 
      applications in other research domains, and more animal research to deepen the 
      understanding of the biological and physiological mechanisms of tDCS stimulation.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of depression in neurologic 
      disorders.
PG  - 381-90
AB  - Depression is commonly associated with neurologic disorders. Although depression 
      in neurologic conditions often is associated with a negative impact on quality of 
      life, it frequently is poorly managed. Some factors, such as a multidrug regimen, 
      lack of efficacy, and side effects of antidepressants may explain why depression 
      is not adequately treated in patients with neurologic disorders. Therefore, this 
      population needs new approaches for depression treatment, and repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be one of them because it has been 
      shown to be effective for the treatment of depression alone and depression in 
      certain neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's disease and stroke. rTMS is a 
      noninvasive, focal, and painless treatment associated with few, mild side 
      effects. It may be effective in the treatment of neurologic diseases such as 
      Parkinson's disease, stroke, and epilepsy. In this paper, we discuss the 
      potential risks and benefits of rTMS treatment for depression in Parkinson's 
      disease, epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Lastly, a 
      framework that includes the parameters of stimulation (intensity, frequency, 
      number of pulses, and site of stimulation) for the treatment of depression in 
      neurologic diseases is proposed.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disease of the young 
      adults. Although being long considered as a pure white matter (WM) disease, 
      growing evidence indicates that in MS the gray matter (GM) is affected as well, 
      and that GM pathology correlates with cognitive function deterioration in MS. 
      Indeed, MS is increasingly recognized to cause cognitive deficits since its early 
      stages. Therefore, the identification of a biomarker with good diagnostic and 
      prognostic power is of great importance for monitoring and preventing cognitive 
      impairment in MS patients. A possibility arises from the combination of two 
      different measures of neuronal injury: the levels of amyloid-β(1-42) in 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which have been found associated with cognitive 
      decline in Alzheimer disease (AD); the brain synaptic plasticity, which is a 
      measure of cognitive reserve and can be explored safely in humans by means of 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation. In this review, we discuss the relevance of 
      amyloid-β(1-42) in MS disease and its link to long-term potentiation (LTP), which 
      is the most studied form of synaptic plasticity, providing evidence for their 
      combined use in cognitive assessment in MS patients.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation of degenerating brain: a comparison of normal 
      aging, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease.
PG  - 578-96
AB  - Although the brain's ability to change constantly in response to external and 
      internal inputs is now well recognized the mechanisms behind it in normal aging 
      and neurodegeneration are less well understood. To gain a better understanding, 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used extensively to characterize 
      non-invasively the cortical neurophysiology of the aging and degenerating brain. 
      Furthermore, there has been a surge of studies examining whether repetitive TMS 
      (rTMS) can be used to improve functional deficits in various conditions including 
      normal aging, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The results of these studies 
      in normal aging and neurodegeneration have emerged reasonably coherent in 
      delineating the main pathology in spite of considerable technical limitations, 
      omnipresent methodological variability, and extraordinary patient heterogeneity. 
      Nevertheless, comparing and integrating what is known about TMS measurements of 
      cortical excitability and plasticity in disorders that predominantly affect 
      cortical brain structures with disorders that predominantly affect subcortical 
      brain structures may provide better understanding of normal and abnormal brain 
      aging fostering new. The present review provides a TMS perspective of changes in 
      cortical neurophysiology and neurochemistry in normal aging and neurodegeneration 
      by integrating what is revealed in individual TMS measurements of cortical 
      excitability and plasticity in physiological aging, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
      Huntington's, disease. The paper also reflects on current developments in 
      utilizing TMS as a physiologic biomarker to discriminate physiologic aging from 
      neurodegeneration and its potential as a method of therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Ataxic hemiparesis: a narrative review for clinical practice in rehabilitation.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/10749357.2023.2281722 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ataxic hemiparesis (AH) is a well-recognized clinical lacunar stroke 
      syndrome, characterized by paresis with ataxia on the same side of the body. It 
      affects patients with stroke involving the basal ganglia, pons, internal capsule, 
      corona radiata, and thalamus. In the past, lacunar syndrome denotes good 
      functional recovery with low mortality and morbidity rate. However, recent 
      evidence suggests AH has an association with more debilitating outcomes in the 
      long term. OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive narrative review of published 
      literatures on the topics related with AH and update clinical practice including 
      rehabilitation. METHODS: Literature review was performed by using the keywords 
      "Subcortical Ataxia," "Lacunar Stroke," "Diaschisis", and "Ataxic Hemiparesis" on 
      PubMed and Google Scholar Engines from 1978 to 2022. All papers published in 
      English were reviewed and manual search of references from retrieved literature 
      was performed for other relevant articles. RESULTS: A comprehensive review was 
      carried out on the following topics: neuroanatomical localization, pathogenesis, 
      clinical features and clinical assessment scales, pharmacological and 
      non-pharmacological modalities for ataxia treatment, prognosis, and outcome. 
      CONCLUSION: AH imposes significant challenges on stroke survivors when it comes 
      to remediation of balance and coordination. It is associated with increased risk 
      of mortality, stroke recurrence, and dementia. Though application of the concept 
      of neuroplasticity and the utilization of repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation have shown early promising results, further research is needed to 
      establish the practice guidelines for rehabilitation of patients with AH.

AB  - Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been under investigation as adjunct 
      treatment of various neurological disorders with variable success. One challenge 
      is the limited knowledge on what would be effective neuronal targets for an 
      intervention, combined with limited knowledge on the neuronal mechanisms of NIBS. 
      Motivated on the one hand by recent evidence that oscillatory activities in 
      neural systems play a role in orchestrating brain functions and dysfunctions, in 
      particular those of neurological disorders specific of elderly patients, and on 
      the other hand that NIBS techniques may be used to interact with these brain 
      oscillations in a controlled way, we here explore the potential of modulating 
      brain oscillations as an effective strategy for clinical NIBS interventions. We 
      first review the evidence for abnormal oscillatory profiles to be associated with 
      a range of neurological disorders of elderly (e.g., Parkinson's disease (PD), 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, epilepsy), and for these signals of abnormal 
      network activity to normalize with treatment, and/or to be predictive of disease 
      progression or recovery. We then ask the question to what extent existing NIBS 
      protocols have been tailored to interact with these oscillations and possibly 
      associated dysfunctions. Our review shows that, despite evidence for both 
      reliable neurophysiological markers of specific oscillatory dis-functionalities 
      in neurological disorders and NIBS protocols potentially able to interact with 
      them, there are few applications of NIBS aiming to explore clinical outcomes of 
      this interaction. Our review article aims to point out oscillatory markers of 
      neurological, which are also suitable targets for modification by NIBS, in order 
      to facilitate in future studies the matching of technical application to clinical 
      targets.

TI  - The Effect of Cerebellar rTMS on Modulating Motor Dysfunction in Neurological 
      Disorders: a Systematic Review.
PG  - 954-972
LID - 10.1007/s12311-022-01465-6 [doi]
AB  - The effectiveness of cerebellar repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (rTMS) on motor dysfunction in patients with neurological disorders has received 
      increasing attention because of its potential for neuromodulation. However, 
      studies on the neuromodulatory effects, parameters, and safety of rTMS 
      implementation in the cerebellum to alleviate motor dysfunction are limited. This 
      systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of cerebellar 
      rTMS treatment for motor dysfunction caused by neurological disorders and to 
      review popular stimulation parameters. Five electronic databases-Medline, Web of 
      Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Embase-were searched for relevant research 
      published from inception to July 2022. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      that reported the effects of cerebellar rTMS combined with behavioral rating 
      scales on motor dysfunction were eligible for enrollment. Additionally, reference 
      lists of the enrolled studies were manually checked. Among 1156 articles 
      screened, 21 RCTs with 666 subjects were included. rTMS conducted on the 
      cerebellum showed an improvement in stroke (spasticity, balance, and gait), 
      cervical dystonia, Parkinson's disease (tremor), cerebellar ataxia, and essential 
      tremor but not in multiple sclerosis. The 8-shaped coil with a diameter of 70 mm 
      was determined as the most common therapeutic choice. None of the studies 
      reported severe adverse events except mild side effects in three. Therefore, rTMS 
      appears to be a promising and safe technique for the treatment of motor 
      dysfunction, targeting the cerebellum to induce motor behavioral improvement. 
      Further rigorous RCTs, including more samples and longer follow-up periods, are 
      required to precisely explore the effective stimulation parameters and possible 
      mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of swallowing disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) is 
      relatively high. Different physiotherapy interventions for swallowing disorders 
      are available but there is a lack of evidence-based medicine for their 
      effectiveness in PD. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review was to 
      investigate the effects of different physiotherapy interventions on dysphagia in 
      PD. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. 
      We methodically searched databases including PubMed, PEDro, Cochrane Library, 
      Embase, and Web of Science. Studies of any language published up to March 2022 
      were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of non-pharmacological 
      treatment for dysphagia in PD were selected in strict accordance with our 
      exclusion and inclusion criteria. RESULTS: In total, we identified and included 
      10 RCTs in patients with PD undergoing dysphagia. This review involved seven 
      rehabilitation treatments, including acupuncture, expiratory muscle strength 
      training (EMST), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), 
      video-assisted swallowing therapy (VAST), electrical stimulation, and speech and 
      language therapy (SLT). CONCLUSION: For physiotherapy treatments, including 
      acupuncture, EMST, high-frequency rTMS and VAST may be effective treatments for 
      dysphagia in patients with PD. However, there was not enough evidence that 
      electrical stimulation has therapeutic effects on dysphagia in patients with PD.

AB  - We conceptualize brain plasticity as an intrinsic property of the nervous system 
      enabling rapid adaptation in response to changes in an organism's internal and 
      external environment. In prenatal and early postnatal development, plasticity 
      allows for the formation of organized nervous system circuitry and the 
      establishment of functional networks. As the individual is exposed to various 
      sensory stimuli in the environment, brain plasticity allows for functional and 
      structural adaptation and underlies learning and memory. We argue that the 
      mechanisms of plasticity change over the lifespan with different slopes of change 
      in different individuals. These changes play a key role in the clinical phenotype 
      of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism and schizophrenia and 
      neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Altered plasticity not 
      only can trigger maladaptive cascades and can be the cause of deficits and 
      disability but also offers opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions. In 
      this chapter, we discuss the importance of brain plasticity across the lifespan 
      and how neuroplasticity-based therapies offer promise for disorders with 
      otherwise limited effective treatment.

TI  - Cortical afferent inhibition abnormalities reveal cholinergic dysfunction in 
      Parkinson's disease: a reappraisal.
PG  - 1417-1429
LID - 10.1007/s00702-017-1775-y [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder affecting, 
      besides the dopaminergic function, multiple neurotransmission systems, including 
      the cholinergic system. Central cholinergic circuits of human brain can be tested 
      non-invasively by coupling peripheral nerve stimulation with transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex; this test is named short latency 
      afferent inhibition (SAI). SAI abnormalities have been reported in PD patients 
      with gait disturbances and many non-motor symptoms, such as visual hallucinations 
      (VHs), REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), dysphagia, and olfactory impairment. 
      The findings of these TMS studies strongly suggest that cholinergic degeneration 
      is an important contributor to a number of clinical features of PD. TMS and 
      neuropsychological raise the possibility that the presence of RBD, VHs and 
      olfactory dysfunction indicate increased risk of cognitive impairment in patients 
      with PD. Longitudinal studies of the patients are required to verify whether SAI 
      abnormalities can predict a future severe cognitive decline. TMS can provide 
      simple measures that may represent suitable biomarkers of cholinergic 
      neurotransmission in PD. SAI studies enable an early recognition of PD patients 
      with cholinergic system degeneration, and this might allow future targeted 
      cholinergic treatment approaches, in addition to dopaminergic therapy, to 
      ameliorate non-motor and motor clinical symptoms in PD patients.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in old 
      age. Aging process for elders with Parkinson's disease can induce gait 
      disturbances with more functional disabilities than for elders without the 
      disease. Treadmill training as a therapy has resulted in notable effects on the 
      gait of patients with Parkinson's disease and may be a resource for geriatric 
      neurological rehabilitation. This review aimed to study the effects on gait after 
      treadmill training in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease. The search was 
      performed in the databases PubMed®, LILACS, PEDro and EMBASE, with the following 
      keywords: "Parkinson's disease", "elderly", "treadmill training" and "gait 
      evaluation". The quality of the studies included was assessed by PEDro Scale. 
      Eleven studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eight studies were 
      randomized, and only one did a follow-up. One can observe in this review that 
      treadmill training with or without weight support (at least 20 minutes, two to 
      three times a week, with progressive increase of loads, for minimum of 6 weeks) 
      in elderly patients with the Parkinson's disease was effective to improve gait. 
      In addition, both were considered safe (since some studies described the use of 
      belts, even in unsupported training) and can be associated with therapies 
      complementary to gait, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, 
      visual cues or anodal transcranial direct current stimulation. Treadmill training 
      in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease is an intervention that improves 
      gait outcomes, but further studies are required for better proofs.

      Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized 
      by progressive memory deficits, cognitive decline, and spatial disorientation. 
      Non-pharmacological interventions to treat AD have been reported in many 
      meta-analyses (MAs), but robust conclusions have not been made because of 
      variations in the scope, quality, and findings of these reviews. Objective: This 
      work aimed to review existing MAs to provide an overview of existing evidence on 
      the effects of five non-pharmacological interventions in AD patients on three 
      outcomes: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), activities of daily living (ADL), 
      and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive section (ADAS-cog). Methods: 
      The databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science were searched 
      to collect MAs of non-pharmacological interventions for AD. Two reviewers 
      independently conducted literature screening, data extraction, and quality 
      assessment. We assessed the quality of MAs with the Measurement Tool to Assess 
      Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 and assessed the evidence quality for significant 
      outcomes using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and 
      Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results: We found 10 eligible MAs, which included 
      between three (133 patients) and 15 randomized trials (1,217 patients), and five 
      non-pharmacological interventions, namely, acupuncture therapy (40%), exercise 
      intervention (30%), music therapy (10%), cognitive intervention (10%), and 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (10%). All the included MAs 
      were critically low to low quality by AMSTAR 2. Acupuncture therapy and exercise 
      intervention showed the preliminary potential to improve ADL and MMSE. rTMS and 
      acupuncture therapy show benefits in decreasing ADAS-cog, and there were some 
      evidence of improved MMSE with cognitive intervention. All these outcomes scored 
      very low quality to moderate quality of evidence on the GRADE system. 
      Conclusions: Non-pharmacological therapy shows promise for the treatment of AD, 
      but there is still a lack of high-quality evidence. In the future, the quality of 
      the original research needs to be improved, and strictly designed MAs should be 
      carried out following methodological requirements.

TI  - The epigenetic component of the brain response to electromagnetic stimulation in 
      Parkinson's Disease patients: A literature overview.
PG  - 3-14
LID - 10.1002/bem.22083 [doi]
AB  - Modulations of epigenetic machinery, namely DNA methylation pattern, histone 
      modification, and non-coding RNAs expression, have been recently included among 
      the key determinants contributing to Parkinson's Disease (PD) aetiopathogenesis 
      and response to therapy. Along this line of reasoning, a set of experimental 
      findings are highlighting the epigenetic-based response to electromagnetic (EM) 
      therapies used to alleviate PD symptomatology, mainly Deep Brain Stimulation 
      (DBS) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Notwithstanding the proven 
      efficacy of EM therapies, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the brain 
      response to these types of stimulations are still far from being elucidated. In 
      this review we provide an overview of the epigenetic changes triggered by DBS and 
      TMS in both PD patients and neurons from different experimental animal models. 
      Furthermore, we also propose a critical overview of the exposure modalities 
      currently applied, in order to evaluate the technical robustness and dosimetric 
      control of the stimulation, which are key issues to be carefully assessed when 
      new molecular findings emerge from experimental studies. Bioelectromagnetics.

AB  - Neuroplasticity, which is the dynamic structural and functional reorganization of 
      central nervous system connectivity due to environmental and internal demands, is 
      recognized as a major physiological basis for adaption of cognition, and 
      behavior, and thus of utmost importance for normal brain function. Pathological 
      alterations of plasticity are increasingly explored as pathophysiological 
      foundation of diverse neurological and psychiatric diseases. Non-invasive brain 
      stimulation techniques (NIBS), such as repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are able 
      to induce and modulate neuroplasticity in humans. Therefore, they have potential 
      to alter pathological plasticity on the one hand, and foster physiological 
      plasticity on the other, in neuropsychiatric diseases to reduce symptoms, and 
      enhance rehabilitation. tDCS is an emerging NIBS tool, which induces 
      glutamatergic plasticity via application of relatively weak currents through the 
      scalp in humans. In the last years its efficacy to treat neuropsychiatric 
      diseases has been explored increasingly. In this review, we will give an overview 
      of pathological alterations of plasticity in neuropsychiatric diseases, gather 
      clinical studies involving tDCS to ameliorate symptoms, and discuss future 
      directions of application, with an emphasis on optimizing stimulation effects.

TI  - Emerging analgesic drugs for Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 157-71
LID - 10.1517/14728214.2012.677949 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pain affects between 40 and 85% of Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      patients. It is a frequently disabling and overlooked feature, which can 
      significantly reduce health-related quality of life. Unfortunately, there are no 
      universally recommended treatments for this condition. AREAS COVERED: Evidence 
      about the efficacy and safety of available analgesic treatments is summarized in 
      this review. Potential targets for upcoming therapies are then discussed in light 
      of what is currently known about the physiopathology of pain in PD. Protocols for 
      efficacy and safety assessment of novel analgesic therapies are discussed. 
      Finally, critical aspects of study protocol design such as patient selection or 
      outcomes to be evaluated are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Preliminary results 
      indicate that duloxetine, cranial electrotherapy stimulation, rotigotine, 
      subthalamic or pallidum nuclei stimulation or lesion or levodopa could be 
      effective for treating pain in PD. Similarly, some case reports indicate that 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or apomorphine could be 
      effective for relieving painful off-period dystonia. Clinical trials with rTMS or 
      oxycodone/naloxone prolonged-release tablets for neuropathic pain or botulinum 
      toxin for off-period dystonia are underway. Success of clinical trials about 
      analgesic strategies in PD will depend on the selection of the right PD 
      population to be treated, according to the type of pain, and the proper selection 
      of study outcomes and follow-up of international recommendations.

AB  - Recent studies have used non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such 
      as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS), to increase dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
      activity and, consequently, working memory (WM) performance. However, such 
      experiments have yielded mixed results, possibly due to small sample sizes and 
      heterogeneity of outcomes. Therefore, our aim was to perform a systematic review 
      and meta-analyses on NIBS studies assessing the n-back task, which is a reliable 
      index for WM. From the first data available to February 2013, we looked for 
      sham-controlled, randomized studies that used NIBS over the DLPFC using the 
      n-back task in PubMed/MEDLINE and other databases. Twelve studies (describing 33 
      experiments) matched our eligibility criteria. Active vs. sham NIBS was 
      significantly associated with faster response times (RTs), higher percentage of 
      correct responses and lower percentage of error responses. However, 
      meta-regressions showed that tDCS (vs. rTMS) presented only an improvement in RT, 
      and not in accuracy. This could have occurred in part because almost all tDCS 
      studies employed a crossover design, possibly due to the reliable tDCS blinding. 
      Study design was also associated with no improvement in correct responses in the 
      active vs. sham groups. To conclude, rTMS of the DLPFC significantly improved all 
      measures of WM performance whereas tDCS significantly improved RT, but not the 
      percentage of correct and error responses. Mechanistic insights on the role of 
      DLPFC in WM are further discussed, as well as how NIBS techniques could be used 
      in neuropsychiatric samples presenting WM deficits, such as major depression, 
      dementia and schizophrenia.

TI  - Interventional psychiatry in the management of behavioural and psychological 
      symptoms of dementia: a qualitative review.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: &ldquo;Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia&rdquo; 
      (BPSD) refers to a heterogeneous group of clinical manifestations related to 
      dementia, including apathy, depression, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations, 
      sexual or social disinhibition, sleep-wake cycle disturbances, aggression, 
      agitation and other behaviours considered inappropriate. Because of the 
      complexity and heterogeneity of BPSD, as well as the fragility and multimorbidity 
      of the elderly, pharmacological treatment appears to be limited in terms of 
      safety and efficacy, and nonpharmacological therapies are today considered the 
      first choice. There is growing evidence that interventional approaches such as 
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), deep brain stimulation 
      (DBS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) could be safe and efficient options for 
      several psychiatric illnesses in a population presenting resistance to and/or 
      intolerance of pharmacotherapy. AIMS: The aim of the present work is to provide a 
      qualitative review of the state of the art in interventional psychiatry in the 
      treatment of BPSD. A particular focus will be on depression and agitation, which 
      represent major stressors on caregivers and a primary cause of 
      institutionalisation. CONCLUSIONS: ECT is probably the most promising 
      interventional procedure needing further investigation in order to obtain 
      specific protocols and a consensus on indications. Preliminary data on rTMS, 
      tDCS, and VNS are encouraging although randomised controlled trials to 
      investigate and compare their efficacy in the treatment of BPSD are still 
      lacking. Their feasibility profile could represent an important advantage over 
      ECT. DBS could represent a very effective therapy for behavioural disorders, but 
      knowledge of the precise neuroanatomical targets for BPSD is currently too 
      limited to justify this invasive approach.

AB  - Emerging brain technologies have significantly transformed human life in recent 
      decades. For instance, the closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI) is an 
      advanced software-hardware system that interprets electrical signals from 
      neurons, allowing communication with and control of the environment. The system 
      then transmits these signals as controlled commands and provides feedback to the 
      brain to execute specific tasks. This paper analyzes and presents the latest 
      research on closed-loop BCI that utilizes electric/magnetic stimulation, 
      optogenetic, and sonogenetic techniques. These techniques have demonstrated great 
      potential in improving the quality of life for patients suffering from 
      neurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases. We provide a comprehensive and 
      systematic review of research on the modalities of closed-loop BCI in recent 
      decades. To achieve this, the authors used a set of defined criteria to shortlist 
      studies from well-known research databases into categories of brain stimulation 
      techniques. These categories include deep brain stimulation, transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct-current stimulation, transcranial 
      alternating-current stimulation, and optogenetics. These techniques have been 
      useful in treating a wide range of disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
      disease, dementia, and depression. In total, 76 studies were shortlisted and 
      analyzed to illustrate how closed-loop BCI can considerably improve, enhance, and 
      restore specific brain functions. The analysis revealed that literature in the 
      area has not adequately covered closed-loop BCI in the context of cognitive 
      neural prosthetics and implanted neural devices. However, the authors demonstrate 
      that the applications of closed-loop BCI are highly beneficial, and the 
      technology is continually evolving to improve the lives of individuals with 
      various ailments, including those with sensory-motor issues or cognitive 
      deficiencies. By utilizing emerging techniques of stimulation, closed-loop BCI 
      can safely improve patients' cognitive and affective skills, resulting in better 
      healthcare outcomes.

PG  - 803-7
AB  - To date, various kinds of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) methods have 
      been widely used in clinical neurology. For the clinical examination, 
      single-pulse TMS is generally used, whereas, for the future therapy, repetitive 
      TMS (rTMS) is widely researched. To evaluate the function of corticospinal tract, 
      central motor conduction time (CMCT) is measured using single-pulse TMS. For 
      precise analyses, single-pulse and double-pulse magnetic brainstem stimulation 
      are performed to measure the cortical-brainstem conduction time and 
      brainstem-spinal conduction time. To evaluate corticospinal tract function for 
      leg muscles, cortico-conus motor conduction time (CCCT) is considered to be more 
      accurate than CMCT. Magnetic cerebellar stimulation is effective to distinguish 
      the cerebellar afferent pathway dysfunction from cerebellar efferent or 
      cerebellar cortical dysfunctions. In animal research, rTMS releases the dopamine 
      in monkey's brain and induces functional changes lasting over one week. In fact, 
      as compared to sham-rTMS, high-frequency rTMS (5Hz) over the supplementary motor 
      area has been shown to be significantly effective in the patients with 
      Parkinson's disease. A new patterned rTMS protocol, quadripulse stimulation 
      (QPS), can produce a bidirectional motor cortical plasticity depending on the 
      interval of the pulses within a burst. rTMS including QPS might relieve symptoms 
      in patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders.

LID - 10.1080/14737175.2016.1219251 [doi]
AB  - This review will first discuss evidence of motor and sensory abnormalities as 
      yielded by neurophysiological techniques in patients with PD. It will then go on 
      to describe the effects of L-dopa replacement on motor and sensory abnormalities 
      in PD as assessed by neurophysiological studies. Areas covered: We analyzed 
      papers in English using Pubmed with the following keywords: L-dopa, dopamine, 
      bradykinesia, basal ganglia, kinematic analysis, TMS, motor cortex plasticity, 
      motor cortex excitability, somatosensory discrimination threshold, pain Expert 
      commentary: L-dopa improves the amplitude and speed of upper limb voluntary 
      movements, but it does not restore abnormalities in the sequence effect or 
      voluntary facial movements. L-dopa only partially normalizes changes in motor 
      cortex excitability and plasticity and has also contrasting effects on the 
      sensory system and on sensory-motor integration. The neurophysiological studies 
      reviewed here show that PD is more than a hypo-dopaminergic disease, and 
      non-dopaminergic mechanisms should also be considered.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This systematic review and meta-analysis study investigates the 
      efficacy of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial 
      direct current stimulation (tDCS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS) using 
      neuropsychological assessments as a potential treatment option for Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for 
      studies on rTMS, tDCS, and DBS for the treatment of patients with AD between 
      April 1970 and October 2022. The mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and AD 
      Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) were adopted as the efficacy 
      index. RESULTS: The analysis yielded 17 eligible studies. rTMS greatly improved 
      the cognition of patients with AD (immediate post-treatment WMD of MMSE score: 
      2.06, p < 0.00001; short-term follow-up WMD of MMSE score: 2.12, p = 0.006; WMD 
      of ADAS-Cog score in single-arm studies: -4.97, p = 0.001). DBS did not reverse 
      the progression of cognitive decline (WMD of ADAS-Cog score in single-arm 
      studies: 7.40, p < 0.00001). Furthermore, tDCS demonstrated no significant 
      efficacy in improving cognition in random clinical trials or single-arm studies. 
      CONCLUSION: rTMS is a promising non-medicinal alternative for cognitive 
      improvement inpatients with AD.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the primary motor cortex in the 
      treatment of motor signs in Parkinson's disease: A quantitative review of the 
      literature.
PG  - 750-8
LID - 10.1002/mds.26206 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder characterized by the emergence 
      of motor deficits. In light of the voluminous and conflicting findings in the 
      literature, the aim of the present quantitative review was to examine the effects 
      of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the primary 
      motor cortex (M1) in the treatment of motor signs in PD. Studies meeting 
      inclusion criteria were analyzed using meta-analytic techniques and the Unified 
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) sections II and III were used as outcome 
      measures. In order to determine the treatment effects of rTMS, the UPDRS II and 
      III scores obtained at baseline, same day, to 1 day post rTMS treatment 
      (short-term follow-up) and 1-month post stimulation (long-term follow-up) were 
      compared between the active and sham rTMS groups. Additionally, the placebo 
      effect was evaluated as the changes in UPDRS III scores in the sham rTMS groups. 
      A placebo effect was not demonstrated, because sham rTMS did not improve motor 
      signs as measured by UPDRS III. Compared with sham rTMS, active rTMS targeting 
      the M1 significantly improved UPDRS III scores at the short-term follow-up 
      (Cohen's d of 0.27, UPDRS III score improvement of 3.8 points). When the 
      long-term follow-up UPDRS III scores were compared with baseline scores, the 
      standardized effect size between active and sham rTMS did not reach significance. 
      However, this translated into a significant nonstandardized 6.3-point improvement 
      on the UPDRS III. No significant improvement in the UPDRS II was found. rTMS over 
      the M1 may improve motor signs. Further studies are needed to provide a definite 
      conclusion.

AB  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary state between 
      normal aging and dementia. It has a high risk of progression in patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is 
      a non-invasive brain stimulation technique used to improve cognitive deficits in 
      patients with MCI and AD. Although previous meta-analyses included studies 
      carried on patients with MCI and AD, few studies have analyzed patients with MCI 
      independently. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects and safety of 
      rTMS on cognition function in patients with MCI and factors that may influence 
      such effects. Methods: Data used in this study were searched and screened from 
      different databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane 
      Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Technical 
      Periodicals (VIP), Wanfang Database, and China BioMedical Literature Database 
      (SinoMed). The retrieved studies were carefully reviewed, data were extracted, 
      and the quality of data was assessed. Results: A total of 12 studies involving 
      329 patients with MCI were included in the present meta-analysis. The analyses 
      results revealed that rTMS improved cognitive function [standardized mean 
      difference (SMD) = 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.44-1.22, p = 0.0009] 
      and memory function (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.48-0.97, p < 0.00001) in the MCI + 
      rTMS active group when compared to the sham stimulation group. The showed that: 
      (1) cognitive improvement was more pronounced under high-frequency rTMS 
      stimulation of multiple sites, such as the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex and (2) more than 10 rTMS stimulation sessions produced higher improvement 
      on cognition function in patients with MCI. Conclusions: This study shows that 
      rTMS can improve cognitive function in patients with MCI, especially when applied 
      at high frequency, multi-site, and for a prolonged period. However, further 
      studies are required to validate these findings and explore more effective 
      stimulation protocols and targets. Systematic Review Registration:

TI  - Effects of Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) on Cognitive Impairment in Mild 
      Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer Disease: A Meta-analysis.
PG  - 278-288
LID - 10.1097/WAD.0000000000000464 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the beneficial 
      effects and optimal stimulation protocol of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) 
      including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial 
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) on patients with mild cognitive impairment and 
      Alzheimer disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the 
      Cochrane Library were searched until March 2020. The cognitive outcomes were 
      extracted and the standardized mean difference with 95% confidence interval was 
      calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included. The result of NIBS 
      showed significant effect on global cognition (P<0.05). Low-frequency rTMS over 
      right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) over 
      left DLPFC, and the tDCS over left DLPFC and temporal lobe can significantly 
      improve the memory function (P<0.05). HF-rTMS over left, right, or bilateral 
      DLPFC can significantly improve the language function (P<0.05). Both HF-rTMS and 
      tDCS over left DLPFC can obviously improve the executive function (P<0.05). 
      Multiple sessions of rTMS with 80% to 100% intensity and anode tDCS with 2 mA 
      current density are more suitable for all these functions. CONCLUSIONS: NIBS has 
      a beneficial effect on cognitive performance in both mild cognitive impairment 
      and Alzheimer disease patients. Distinct optimal stimulation parameters were 
      observed for different cognitive functions.

TI  - Treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 234-40
AB  - Depression is one of the most common nonmotor features observed in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD), affecting approximately 40% of patients. Depression in Parkinson's 
      disease (dPD) significantly affects quality of life of both patients and their 
      families and has been shown to be more predictive of distress than motor 
      disability. Depression frequently goes unrecognized in this population, however, 
      in part because the diagnosis is often complicated by the overlap of psychiatric 
      and PD symptoms. The etiology of dPD is unclear; dopaminergic, serotonergic, and 
      noradrenergic systems may be implicated. Options for managing dPD include 
      antidepressant medication; cognitive-behavioral therapy; behavioral lifestyle 
      interventions such as exercise; and, in refractory cases, noninvasive brain 
      stimulation (electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation). 
      Randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of 
      interventional approaches for dPD; several trials are currently underway.

TI  - Noninvasive brain stimulation for behavioural and psychological symptoms of 
      dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1336-1345
LID - 10.1002/gps.5003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacological and conventional nonpharmacological treatments for 
      behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) have only modest 
      efficacy. Furthermore, pharmacotherapy carries the risk of important side 
      effects. Noninvasive brain stimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)) are valuable 
      and safe for cognitive function in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, there have 
      been few studies, and there is no consensus, regarding the use of these 
      techniques to treat BPSD. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the 
      literature and meta-analysis of studies reporting the effect of rTMS or tDCS on 
      BPSD. RESULTS: Seven articles were included: five randomized, controlled clinical 
      trials and two open-label clinical trials. Five studies investigated the effects 
      of rTMS and two the effects of tDCS. Both studies using tDCS reported no evidence 
      of efficacy on BPSD, while two of the three RCTs using rTMS found statistically 
      significant benefits. In an exploratory meta-analysis with four of the RCT 
      studies, we did not find evidence of efficacy of noninvasive brain stimulation 
      techniques, with an overall effect of -0.02 (95% CI = -0.90, 0.94; I(2)  = 85%). 
      However, when we used only the data from the studies that applied rTMS, we found 
      a positive effect on BPSD, with an overall effect of -0.58 (95% CI = -1.02, 
      -0.14; I(2)  = 0%). With regards to the adverse effects reported, these were mild 
      and not clinically relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results establish a tendency for 
      efficacy of rTMS protocols on BPSD, while corroborating their safety and 
      tolerability, suggesting the need for further research.

AB  - Delirium is a common problem associated with substantial morbidity and increased 
      mortality. However, the brain dysfunction that leads some individuals to develop 
      delirium in response to stressors is unclear. In this article, we briefly review 
      the neurophysiologic literature characterizing the changes in brain function that 
      occur in delirium, and in other cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. 
      Based on this literature, we propose a conceptual model for delirium. We propose 
      that delirium results from a breakdown of brain function in individuals with 
      impairments in brain connectivity and brain plasticity exposed to a stressor. The 
      validity of this conceptual model can be tested using Transcranial Magnetic 
      Stimulation in combination with Electroencephalography, and, if accurate, could 
      lead to the development of biomarkers for delirium risk in individual patients. 
      This model could also be used to guide interventions to decrease the risk of 
      cerebral dysfunction in patients preoperatively, and facilitate recovery in 
      patients during or after an episode of delirium.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation: a neuropsychiatric tool for the 21st century.
PG  - 373-82
AB  - Neuroscientists have constantly sought new methods of evaluating brain function, 
      with progressive improvement in the last century in imaging brain structure and 
      function. However, except for direct surgical stimulation, neuropsychiatrists can 
      only infer causality between the signal obtained on an image and a behavior or 
      disease. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a new, noninvasive technique 
      for directly stimulating cortical neurons. It has been used to map attention, 
      memory, movement, speech, and vision. Preliminary investigations have also used 
      rapid-rate TMS to improve motor speed in Parkinson's disease and mood in 
      depression. TMS is likely to be an important future neuropsychiatric tool.

TI  - Translational Challenge Models in Support of Efficacy Studies: Neurobehavioral 
      and Cognitive Changes Induced by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Healthy 
      Volunteers.
PG  - 802-15
AB  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was proposed as a neurophysiological tool 
      almost three decades ago. It now encompasses a very wide range of applications 
      including clinical research and the treatment of psychiatric, neurologic and 
      medical conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, addictions, post-traumatic 
      stress disorders, pain, migraine, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, autism, multiple 
      sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. By inducing electrical brain responses through 
      the administration of magnetic pulses, TMS is in a unique position to painlessly 
      modulate cortical regions and offers good spatial resolution and excellent 
      temporal resolution, particularly when applied using single pulses. However, 
      despite the impressive number of papers describing the use of TMS to modulate 
      cognitive functions, the mechanisms underlying the behavioral changes observed 
      after stimulation have not been fully identified. Here we present a review of the 
      ability of TMS to transiently compromise brain function in humans. The primary 
      aim was to investigate its capacity for use as a 'cognitive challenge model' in 
      human pharmacological studies. The data reviewed include findings on executive 
      function, attention and episodic memory. For each cognitive process, the 
      convergent and divergent results are discussed in terms of paradigm differences 
      and in order to define the optimal methodology for obtaining the desired effects.

TI  - Therapies for dopaminergic-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson disease.
PG  - 919-27
LID - 10.1002/ana.22423 [doi]
AB  - Existing and emerging strategies for managing L-dopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) 
      in patients with Parkinson disease have involved either delaying the introduction 
      of L-dopa therapy, treatment with an antidyskinetic agent, using a therapy or 
      delivery system that can provide continuous dopaminergic stimulation, or using 
      novel agents that target receptors implicated in the mechanisms underlying LIDs. 
      Treatment with dopamine agonists such as pramipexole or ropinirole allows 
      levodopa to be delayed, but once levodopa is added to the drug regimen the usual 
      course of onset of dyskinesias is observed. Amantadine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate 
      antagonist, is so far the only approved compound with evidence of providing a 
      sustained antidyskinetic benefit in the absence of unacceptable side effects. 
      These findings support the hypothesis of glutamate overactivity in the 
      development of dyskinesias. More continuous delivery of dopaminergic medication, 
      such as through intraintestinal or subcutaneous routes, is promising but invasive 
      and associated with injection site reactions. As a result of molecular research 
      and elucidation of the role of a variety of neurotransmitters in the mechanism of 
      LIDs, new compounds have been identified, including those that modulate the 
      direct and indirect striatal output pathways; some of these new agents are in the 
      early stages of development or undergoing proof-of-concept evaluation as 
      antidyskinetic agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacological interventions, including noninvasive 
      neuromodulation, may alleviate apathy in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. 
      This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of 
      neuromodulation for apathy in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or 
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: The Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched for randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) of neuromodulation for apathy in AD or MCI. The primary 
      outcome was change in apathy based on the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Secondary 
      outcomes were change in global cognition and trial discontinuation. RESULTS: The 
      meta-analysis included four RCTs involving 89 patients (aged 65.6-80.5 years) 
      with apathy in AD or MCI. Findings showed no significant improvement in apathy 
      (SMD = 0.57, 95% CI = -0.22-1.36; P = 0.16) or global cognition (SMD = 0.83, 95% 
      CI = -0.11-1.78; P = 0.08) with neuromodulation compared to sham. Subgroup 
      analyses showed significant improvement in apathy with high-frequency rTMS at 
      120% RMT compared to sham (SMD = 1.36, [95% CI = 0.61-2.12]; P = 0.0004), but not 
      with rTMS at 80% RMT. For global cognition, high-frequency rTMS resulted in 
      significant enhancement (SMD = 1.34 [95% CI = 0.59-2.10]; P = 0.0005), but no 
      notable difference was observed with tDCS compared to sham. There was no 
      significant difference in trial discontinuation in patients with AD or MCI 
      treated with neuromodulation compared to sham. CONCLUSION: High-frequency rTMS at 
      120% RMT for four weeks may be efficacious and safe for the treatment of apathy 
      in elderly patients with AD or MCI. High-frequency rTMS may also improve global 
      cognition in these patients. This implies rTMS has potential as an intervention 
      for apathy in AD and MCI. Large well conducted RCTs are warranted to explore this 
      effect further.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early decline of episodic memory is detectable in subjective 
      cognitive decline (SCD). The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is 
      associated with encoding episodic memories. Repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) is a novel and viable tool to improve cognitive function in 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment, but the treatment effect 
      in SCD has not been studied. We aim to investigate the efficacy of rTMS on 
      episodic memory in individuals with SCD, and to explore the potential mechanisms 
      of neural plasticity. METHODS: In our randomized, sham-controlled trial, patients 
      (n = 60) with SCD will receive 20 sessions (5 consecutive days per week for 4 
      weeks) of real rTMS (n = 30) or sham rTMS (n = 30) over the left DLPFC. The 
      primary outcome is the Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Huashan version (AVLT-H). 
      Other neuropsychological examinations and the long-term potentiation (LTP)-like 
      cortical plasticity evaluation serve as the secondary outcomes. These outcomes 
      will be assessed before and at the end of the intervention. DISCUSSION: If the 
      episodic memory of SCD improve after the intervention, the study will confirm 
      that rTMS is a promising intervention for cognitive function improvement on the 
      early stage of dementia. This study will also provide important clinical evidence 
      for early intervention in AD and emphasizes the significance that impaired 
      LTP-like cortical plasticity may be a potential biomarker of AD prognosis by 
      demonstrating the predictive role of LTP on cognitive improvement in SCD. ETHICS 
      AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee 
      of the hospital (No. 2023-002-01). The results will be published in peer-review 
      publications. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://www.chictr.org.cn/, identifier

AB  - Several studies demonstrated in experimental models and in humans synaptic 
      plasticity impairment in some neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases 
      such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and 
      schizophrenia. Recently new neurophysiological tools, such as repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation, 
      have been introduced in experimental and clinical settings for studying 
      physiology of the brain and modulating cortical activity. These techniques use 
      noninvasive transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation to modulate neurons 
      activity in the human brain. Cortical stimulation might enhance or inhibit the 
      activity of cortico-subcortical networks, depending on stimulus frequency and 
      intensity, current polarity, and other stimulation parameters such as the 
      configuration of the induced electric field and stimulation protocols. On this 
      basis, in the last two decades, these techniques have rapidly become valuable 
      tools to investigate physiology of the human brain and have been applied to treat 
      drug-resistant neurological and psychiatric diseases. Here we describe these 
      techniques and discuss the mechanisms that may explain these effects.

AB  - Over the last decade, electrophysiological studies in parkinsonian animals have 
      shown that there are abnormalities of synaptic plasticity in motor areas of 
      cortex and basal ganglia. In humans with Parkinson's disease (PD), cortical 
      plasticity has been widely investigated using transcranial magnetic stimulation. 
      A number of studies have reported abnormal responses to several different 
      conditioning protocols, but their relationship to altered basal ganglia output 
      and dopaminergic loss is still not entirely clear. Thus in the near future it 
      seems unlikely that measures of cortical plasticity could be used as a biomarker 
      of disease severity and progression. In this review we provide an overview on 
      current knowledge of abnormalities of plasticity in PD in the light of recent 
      advances in parkinsonian animal models. Finally we will discuss the relevance of 
      abnormalities of plasticity in the clinical context of PD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess efficacy and 
      safety of a new patterned theta burst stimulation algorithm of DBS with the aim 
      of expanding the therapeutic window and clinical benefit in PD. METHODS: In this 
      single-center, randomized, double-blind, clinical short-term trial, unilateral 
      conventional subthalamic DBS was compared with unilateral patterned stimulation 
      algorithms with intraburst high- or low-frequency theta burst stimulation in 17 
      PD patients. RESULTS: There were no serious adverse events with theta burst 
      stimulation. During monopolar review, conventional subthalamic DBS and 
      high-frequency theta burst stimulation were comparable, but low-frequency theta 
      burst stimulation differed by requiring higher stimulation amplitudes for symptom 
      reduction, but a larger therapeutic window. High- and low-frequency theta burst 
      stimulation with adapted stimulation amplitude were effective in PD symptom 
      reduction with differential effects on akinesia and tremor, depending on the 
      theta burst stimulation mode. CONCLUSIONS: Theta burst stimulation is a safe and 
      effective stimulation mode with potential future application opportunities. ©

AB  - Sleep plays a critical role in the process of memory consolidation. In 
      particular, during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) slow wave sleep, 
      slow-oscillations, spindles, hippocampal sharp wave ripples, and their phase 
      coupling are involved in the process of transferring and consolidating 
      information recently encoded and temporarily stored in the hippocampus into 
      long-term memory stored in the neocortex. There is evidence that aging and 
      neurodegenerative conditions, in particular Alzheimer's disease, are associated 
      with changes to this transient grouping of NREM oscillations. Therefore, methods 
      to enhance sleep, particularly slow wave sleep, have the potential to improve 
      cognitive performance. Transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation have been 
      shown useful to enhance sleep slow-waves and sleep-dependent memory 
      consolidation, however there is need for more information regarding proper 
      protocols of application and applicability and efficacy in patients with 
      neurodegenerative conditions. Acoustic stimulation during sleep has been proven 
      particularly effective in enhancing sleep slow-waves and spindles with associated 
      improvement in overnight memory consolidation. More importantly, preliminary data 
      indicate that similar results can be achieved in healthy older adults and those 
      with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Studies are needed to optimize the 
      modalities of acoustic stimulation during sleep, which may vary based on age 
      group or clinical disorder. Overall, non-invasive techniques of neurostimulation 
      may represent a valid approach to mitigate cognitive decline associated with 
      aging and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, they offer the unique opportunity to 
      improve our understanding of the physiology behind sleep-dependent memory 
      consolidation.

BTI - Electroconvulsive Therapy for the Treatment of the Behavioural and Psychological 
      Symptoms of Dementia: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Guidelines
AB  - Dementia refers to a state of cognitive impairment in the presence of impaired 
      language or physical function that cannot be attributed to delirium or any other 
      medical, neurological or psychiatric condition. Dementia manifests in a variety 
      of forms, namely, Alzheimer disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia, frontotemporal 
      lobar dementia, Lewy Body dementia (LBD) or dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), 
      vascular dementia, and dementia associated with Parkinson’s disease (PDD). 
      Commonly observed and often overlapping symptoms of the various forms of dementia 
      include deterioration in memory and adverse changes in mood, behaviour, 
      communication, judgement and reasoning.(,) An estimated 402,000 Canadians aged 65 
      years and older are living with dementia, with this number expected to increase 
      as the population ages and expands. Treatment options for symptoms of dementia 
      include, but are not limited to, antipsychotics, antidepressants, carer 
      education, psychological interventions, physical exercise, gait cueing, 
      environmental modification, music, simulated presence, occupational therapy, 
      physical therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current 
      stimulation, deep brain stimulation, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT 
      refers to the use of short pulses (i.e., pulses lasting less than 2 milliseconds) 
      of electricity to produce a generalized seizure in a symptomatic patient. The 
      impetus for using ECT as a potential treatment option for dementia comes from 
      past observations of positive outcomes in patients with severe psychiatric 
      disorders ranging from schizophrenia to major depressive disorder. Concerns 
      remain however, about adverse effects of ECT and the probability of relapse in 
      those who respond to the treatment. This review aims to summarize published 
      evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and safety of ECT for the treatment 
      of the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in older patients, 
      along with relevant guidelines.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive method of 
      stimulating the brain that changes excitability at the site of stimulation as 
      well as at distant anatomically connected sites. Since the effects can outlast 
      the period of stimulation for minutes or hours and are thought to be depend, at 
      least in part, on changes in the efficiency of synaptic connections in the 
      cortex, the method has generated much interest as a potential therapeutic 
      intervention in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric conditions. A 
      symposium on brain stimulation and brain recovery was held in Greifswald 
      (Germany) in 2010 to exchange of state-of-the-art knowledge about rTMS effects 
      from animal experiments to clinical trials in conditions such as stroke, 
      Parkinson disease, and depression. There was enormous interest in the effects of 
      rTMS and signs of therapeutic success in mainly small clinical trials. However, 
      it was also clear that some of our models of the effects of rTMS, such as 
      upregulation or downregulation of specific brain areas may need further 
      development if they are to account for all the observations that have been made 
      so far. The results of the symposium are made available by lab reviews of members 
      of the symposium's faculty. This editorial provides an overview.

AB  - The review focuses on the clinical diagnostic utility of transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (TMS). The central motor conduction time (CMCT) is a sensitive method 
      to detect myelopathy and abnormalities may be detected in the absence of 
      radiological changes. CMCT may also detect upper motor neuron involvement in 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The diagnostic sensitivity may be increased by 
      using the triple stimulation technique (TST), by combining several parameters 
      such as CMCT, motor threshold and silent period, or by studying multiple muscles. 
      In peripheral facial nerve palsies, TMS may be used to localize the site of nerve 
      dysfunction and clarify the etiology. TMS measures also have high sensitivity in 
      detecting lesions in multiple sclerosis and abnormalities in CMCT or TST may 
      correlate with motor impairment and disability. Cerebellar stimulation may detect 
      lesions in the cerebellum or the cerebellar output pathway. TMS may detect upper 
      motor neuron involvement in patients with atypical parkinsonism and equivocal 
      signs. The ipsilateral silent period that measures transcallosal inhibition is a 
      potential method to distinguish between different parkinsonian syndromes. Short 
      latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which is related to central cholinergic 
      transmission, is reduced in Alzheimer's disease. Changes in SAI following 
      administration of cholinesterase inhibitor may be related to the long-term 
      efficacy of this treatment. The results of MEP measurement in the first week 
      after stroke correlate with functional outcome. We conclude that TMS measures 
      have demonstrated diagnostic utility in myelopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      and multiple sclerosis. TMS measures have potential clinical utility in 
      cerebellar disease, dementia, facial nerve disorders, movement disorders, stroke, 
      epilepsy, migraine and chronic pain.

TI  - Efficacy of scalp stimulation for multidomain cognitive impairment in patients 
      with post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia: A network meta-analysis and 
      meta-regression of moderators.
PG  - 505-519
LID - 10.1111/jebm.12568 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scalp stimulation has gained more traction for post-stroke cognitive 
      impairment and dementia (PSCID); the interaction between stimulation targets and 
      parameters influences the response to the stimulation. However, the most 
      efficacious treatment for improving different domains of cognitive impairment 
      remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a systematic review and network 
      meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the efficacy of various scalp stimulation 
      protocols used in PSCID treatment. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials of scalp 
      stimulation in patients with PSCID were searched in eight databases over the past 
      20 years. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) for global and subdomain cognitive 
      scores were pooled in Bayesian NMA. Moderators were examined using 
      meta-regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 90 trials, with 6199 patients, were 
      included. Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over 
      the unaffected dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was highly suggested for 
      alleviating global severity (SMD = 1.11, 95% CI (0.64, 1.57)). High-frequency 
      rTMS over the left DLPFC was recommended for language use (1.85 (1.18, 2.52)), 
      executive function (0.85 (0.36, 1.33)), orientation deficits (0.59 (0.07, 1.13)), 
      and attention (0.85 (0.27, 1.43)). Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation 
      over the affected DLPFC (2.03 (0.72, 3.34)) was recommended for treating memory 
      impairment. Meta-regression analyses showed significant associations within 
      attention, language and orientation. CONCLUSION: Overall, different cognitive 
      domains have different optimal scalp stimulation prescriptions, and activating 
      the affected key brain regions and inhibiting the unaffected area is still the 
      most effective treatment.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a well known non-invasive 
      brain stimulation procedure which is capable of inducing the expression of the 
      hippocampal BDNF that has been already shown to exert significant neuroprotective 
      and pro-cognitive effects in AD. However, it is nearly impossible directly to 
      evaluate the BDNF expression in humans after rTMS application. Here we summarized 
      the underlying mechanisms of the neuroprotective and procognitive effect of BDNF 
      that can be induced through a region-specific rTMS approach. Additionally, we 
      have also evaluated the role of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in monitoring the 
      BDNF response after rTMS application in Alzheimer's Disease. We have provided 
      strong evidence that rTMS exerts significant neuroprotective and pro-cognitive 
      effects through the expression of hippocampal BDNF. Furthermore, Magnetic 
      Resonance Spectroscopy might play a critical role in monitoring the BDNF response 
      after rTMS application in AD patients. Such a sophisticated approach might be 
      able to enlighten us on the time-dependent cognitive and neuroprotective 
      correlates of the rtMS application in AD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholinergic dysfunction is a key abnormality in Alzheimer disease 
      (AD) that can be detected in vivo with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
      protocols. Although TMS has clearly demonstrated analytical validity, its 
      clinical utility is still debated. In the present study, we evaluated the 
      incremental diagnostic value, expressed in terms of diagnostic confidence of 
      Alzheimer disease (DCAD; range 0-100), of TMS measures in addition to the routine 
      clinical diagnostic assessment in patients evaluated for cognitive impairment as 
      compared with validated biomarkers of amyloidosis. METHODS: One hundred twenty 
      patients with dementia were included and scored in terms of DCAD in a three-step 
      assessment based on (1) demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological evaluations 
      (clinical work-up); (2) clinical work-up plus amyloid markers (cerebrospinal 
      fluid or amyloid positron emission tomographic imaging); and (3) clinical work-up 
      plus TMS intracortical connectivity measures. Two blinded neurologists were asked 
      to review the diagnosis and diagnostic confidence at each step. RESULTS: TMS 
      measures increased the discrimination of DCAD in two clusters (AD-like vs 
      FTD-like) when added to the clinical and neuropsychological evaluations with 
      levels comparable to established biomarkers of brain amyloidosis (cluster 
      distance of 55.1 for clinical work-up alone, 76.0 for clinical work-up plus 
      amyloid markers, 80.0 for clinical work-up plus TMS). Classification accuracy for 
      the "gold standard" diagnosis (dichotomous - AD vs FTD - variable) evaluated in 
      the three-step assessment, expressed as AUC, increased from 0.82 (clinical 
      work-up alone) to 0.98 (clinical work-up plus TMS) and to 0.99 (clinical work-up 
      plus amyloidosis markers). CONCLUSIONS: TMS in addition to routine assessment in 
      patients with dementia has a significant effect on diagnosis and diagnostic 
      confidence that is comparable to well-established amyloidosis biomarkers.

AB  - Executive planning, the ability to direct and sustain attention, language and 
      several types of memory may be compromised by conditions such as stroke, 
      traumatic brain injury, cancer, autism, cerebral palsy and Alzheimer's disease. 
      No medical devices are currently available to help restore these cognitive 
      functions. Recent findings about the neurophysiology of these conditions in 
      humans coupled with progress in engineering devices to treat refractory 
      neurological conditions imply that the time has arrived to consider the design 
      and evaluation of a new class of devices. Like their neuromotor counterparts, 
      neurocognitive prostheses might sense or modulate neural function in a 
      non-invasive manner or by means of implanted electrodes. In order to paint a 
      vision for future device development, it is essential to first review what can be 
      achieved using behavioral and external modulatory techniques. While non-invasive 
      approaches might strengthen a patient's remaining intact cognitive abilities, 
      neurocognitive prosthetics comprised of direct brain-computer interfaces could in 
      theory physically reconstitute and augment the substrate of cognition itself.

AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on 
      cognitive function in healthy older adults and patients with Alzheimer's disease. 
      A comprehensive literature search was performed on noninvasive stimulation 
      studies published from January 1990 to November 2014 in Pubmed and Web of 
      Science. Fourteen articles with a total of 331 participants were identified as 
      studies with healthy older adults, and the mean effect size and 95% confidence 
      interval were estimated. A significant effect size of 0.42 was found for the 
      cognitive outcome. Further subgroup analyses demonstrated more prominent effects 
      for studies delivering the stimulation before the execution of the task and 
      studies applying multiple sessions of stimulation. To assess the effects of 
      stimulation on Alzheimer's disease patients, 11 studies with a total of 200 
      patients were included in the analysis. A significant effect size of 1.35 was 
      found for the cognitive outcomes. Subgroup analyses indicated more pronounced 
      effects for studies applying the stimulation during the execution of the task 
      compared with studies delivering the stimulation before the execution of the 
      task. Noninvasive brain stimulation has a positive effect on cognitive function 
      in physiological and pathological aging.

PG  - e1738-e1754
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000201006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Current genome-wide association studies of ischemic 
      stroke have focused primarily on late-onset disease. As a complement to these 
      studies, we sought to identify the contribution of common genetic variants to 
      risk of early-onset ischemic stroke. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 
      genome-wide association studies of early-onset stroke (EOS), ages 18-59 years, 
      using individual-level data or summary statistics in 16,730 cases and 599,237 
      nonstroke controls obtained across 48 different studies. We further compared 
      effect sizes at associated loci between EOS and late-onset stroke (LOS) and 
      compared polygenic risk scores (PRS) for venous thromboembolism (VTE) between EOS 
      and LOS. RESULTS: We observed genome-wide significant associations of EOS with 2 
      variants in ABO, a known stroke locus. These variants tag blood subgroups O1 and 
      A1, and the effect sizes of both variants were significantly larger in EOS 
      compared with LOS. The odds ratio (OR) for rs529565, tagging O1, was 0.88 (95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.91) in EOS vs 0.96 (95% CI: 0.92-1.00) in LOS, 
      and the OR for rs635634, tagging A1, was 1.16 (1.11-1.21) for EOS vs 1.05 
      (0.99-1.11) in LOS; p-values for interaction = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively. 
      Using PRSs, we observed that greater genetic risk for VTE, another prothrombotic 
      condition, was more strongly associated with EOS compared with LOS (p = 0.008). 
      DISCUSSION: The ABO locus, genetically predicted blood group A, and higher 
      genetic propensity for venous thrombosis are more strongly associated with EOS 
      than with LOS, supporting a stronger role of prothrombotic factors in EOS.

      Disease (AD) patients. METHODS: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL 
      Complete (EBSCO), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang 
      Database were searched. The risk of bias was appraised through the Cochrane 
      collaboration tool. A meta-analysis was conducted, including an assessment of 
      heterogeneity. RESULTS: Ten studies comprising 408 participants were included. 
      The addition of rTMS significantly improved overall cognition in patients 
      compared with cognitive intervention alone (p < 0.05 for all tests). The 
      treatment also had some continuity, with significant improvements in cognitive 
      function within weeks after the treatment ended (p < 0.05 for all tests). 
      CONCLUSION: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with cognitive 
      training (rTMS-CT) is a valuable technique for the cognitive rehabilitation of AD 
      patients. It is beneficial to improve the cognitive ability of patients and 
      restore their overall functional state. The results of the study may provide a 
      basis for clinical providers to implement interventions that facilitate the 
      design of more rigorous and high-quality interventions. LIMITATIONS: The number 
      of studies and sample size in our study were small. We did not explore possible 
      interactions between rTMS and medications and mood improvement after rTMS due to 
      inadequate data. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: This study was registered on 
      PROSPERO with registration number CRD42023405615.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to comprehensively assess the recovery effects 
      of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with 
      poststroke cognitive impairment. METHODS: Six English and four Chinese databases 
      were searched for relevant studies published up to January 2022. Randomized 
      controlled trials of patients with poststroke cognitive impairment treated with 
      high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation were included. 
      Included studies were assessed for the risk of bias through the Cochrane 
      Intervention Systematic Review Manual 5.1.0. The meta-analysis was performed 
      using RevMan 5.4 software. The PRISMA 2020 guidelines were followed. RESULTS: 
      Sixty-one randomized controlled trials (4012 patients) were included. Montreal 
      Cognitive Assessment Score, Mini-Mental State Examination score, event-related 
      potential P300 (P300) amplitude, Loewenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive 
      Assessment score, and total effective rate of cognitive function were higher in 
      the high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation group than in the 
      control group at the end of the treatment period, and scores of Alzheimer Disease 
      Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and P300 latency were lower in the 
      high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation group than in the 
      control group. Fifty studies had selected the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as 
      the stimulation site for high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with nonrepetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation or sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, high-frequency 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation not only improves the overall 
      cognitive function of poststroke cognitive impairment patients but also has 
      better rehabilitation results.

TI  - Transcranial direct current stimulation for global cognition in Alzheimer's 
      disease: a systemic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 883-895
LID - 10.1007/s10072-023-07162-4 [doi]
AB  - This meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS) for general cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
      to investigate the potential influential factors. A systematic literature 
      retrieval until August 2023 was performed by searching the PubMed, Embase, Web of 
      Science, and Cochrane Library. Therapeutic effects of tDCS were evaluated using 
      standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Pooled 
      effects of tDCS on AD patients were calculated immediately after treatment and at 
      follow-up periods. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify the potential 
      prognostic factors. Eleven studies with 12 trials including 451 cases were 
      included in our systemic review, in which 9 studies with 10 trials using 
      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scales were included in the meta-analysis. 
      tDCS significantly improved global cognition in AD immediately after the 
      treatment (SMD, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.66; P<0.0001), but not at the shorter or 
      longer follow-up period. Subgroup analyses suggested significant global cognitive 
      improvement in patients receiving stimulation on temporal lobes instead of left 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and in cases receiving tDCS with current 
      density ≥ 0.08 mA/cm(2) rather than <0.08 mA/cm(2). Compared with tDCS plus 
      cognitive training (CT), tDCS without CT produced obvious cognitive enhancement. 
      In addition, patients with lower education were more likely to benefit from tDCS. 
      tDCS was effective in improving general cognition in AD after treatment. However, 
      further randomized trials are warranted to validate its longer-term effects as 
      well as our subgroup analyses results.

TI  - rTMS effects on levodopa induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease patients: 
      searching for effective cortical targets.
PG  - 561-8
LID - 10.3233/RNN-2010-0556 [doi]
AB  - Long-term therapy with levodopa and dopamine agonists in Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      patients is complicated by the development of fluctuations in motor response, 
      such as levo-dopa induced dyskinesia (LID). Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic 
      Stimulation (rTMS) has been recently put forward as a possible therapeutic tool 
      able to LID in PD. Trains of 1 Hz rTMS applied either over the supplementary 
      motor area (SMA) or the primary motor cortex (M1) were able to induce a transient 
      reduction in the severity of LID, confirming that an over-activity of these areas 
      plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of LID. However, repeated sessions of 
      rTMS were not effective in inducing persistent beneficial clinical effects. 
      Functional or metabolic changes have been reported in the cerebellum in studies 
      in PD patients treated with procedures known to alleviate LID, such as deep brain 
      stimulation. Therefore, the effects of rTMS applied over the lateral cerebellum 
      has been recently tested in patients with LID. A two-week course of bilateral 
      cerebellar rTMS induced persistent clinical beneficial effects, reducing 
      peak-dose LID for up to four weeks after the end of the daily stimulation period. 
      These findings demonstrate that rTMS is a potential tool in individuating the 
      best cortical targets and the optimal parameters of stimulation able to improve 
      LID in dyskinetic PD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is being used as a 
      non-invasive, non-pharmacological treatment with emerging clinical applications. 
      The objective of this systematic review is to assess the possible rTMS effect on 
      memory performance in patients suffering from central nervous system diseases. 
      METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Cochrane Library were 
      searched through April 2021 for rTMS clinical trials in neuropsychiatric 
      conditions, assessing pre-post treatment patients' memory performance with 
      neuropsychological measures. RESULTS: One hundred and four clinical studies were 
      included for evaluation. Overall, a large number of reports were detected with a 
      positive outcome of patients' memory performance, concerning primarily the 
      working memory, whereas there were also inconsistent results. In particular, 
      considerable results were observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment and 
      early stage Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the variability of reports 
      and the limited ability to generalize our findings, this review offers further 
      evidence regarding the possible use of rTMS as a memory enhancement tool. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: The study provides an updated and broad review in the field and 
      highlights the need for more adequate studies, focusing on treatment procedure 
      characteristics, follow-up and maintenance options of this approach.

      oscillatory responses.
PG  - 237-73
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative dementing illness. 
      Early diagnosis at the prodromal stage is an important topic of current research. 
      Significant advances were recently made in the validation process of several 
      biomarkers, including structural/amyloid imaging, cerebrospinal fluid 
      measurements, and glucose positron emission tomography. Nevertheless, there 
      remains a need to develop an efficient, low cost, potentially portable, 
      noninvasive biomarker in the diagnosis, course, or treatment of AD. There is also 
      a great need for a biomarker that would reflect functional brain dynamic changes 
      within a very short time period, such as milliseconds, to provide information 
      about cognitive deficits. Electrophysiological methods have the highest time 
      resolution for reflecting brain dynamics in cognitive impairments. There are 
      several strategies available for measuring cognitive changes, including 
      spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG), sensory-evoked oscillations (SEOs), and 
      event-related oscillations (EROs). The term "sensory-evoked" (SE) implies 
      responses elicited upon simple sensory stimulation, whereas "event-related" (ER) 
      indicates responses elicited upon a cognitive task, generally an oddball 
      paradigm. Further selective connectivity deficit in sensory or cognitive networks 
      is reflected by coherence measurements. When simple sensory stimulus is used, a 
      sensory network becomes activated, whereas an oddball task initiates an 
      activation in a sensory network and additionally in a related cognitive network. 
      In AD, spontaneous activity reveals a topographically changed pattern of 
      oscillations. In addition, the most common finding in spontaneous EEG of AD is 
      decrease of fast and increase of slow frequencies. The hyperexcitability of motor 
      and sensory cortices in AD has been demonstrated in many studies. The motor 
      cortex hyperexcitability has been shown by transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      studies. Also, the SEOs reflecting sensory network indicate a visual sensory 
      cortex hyperexcitability in AD, as demonstrated by increased responses over 
      posterior regions of the hemispheres. On the other hand, ERO studies reflecting 
      activation of a cognitive network imply decreased responses in fronto-central 
      regions of the brain in delta and theta frequencies. Coherence studies show the 
      connectivity between different parts of the brain. Studies of SE coherence in 
      mild AD subjects imply almost intact connectivity in all frequency ranges, 
      whereas ER coherence is decreased in wide connections in alpha, theta, and delta 
      frequency ranges. Moreover, alpha ER coherence seems to be sensitive to 
      cholinergic treatment in AD. In further research in a search of AD biomarkers, 
      multimodal methods should be introduced to electrophysiology in order to validate 
      these methods. Standardization and harmonization of user-friendly acquisition and 
      analysis protocols in larger cohort populations are also needed in order to 
      incorporate electrophysiology as a part of the clinical criteria of AD.

AB  - The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying normal aging and neurodegenerative 
      disorders represent the focus of a bulk of recent research. Physiological brain 
      aging is characterized by a progressive dysfunction and loss of synaptic contacts 
      and neuronal abnormal apoptosis. Neural and synaptic redundancy as well as 
      functional and structural plastic remodeling of brain networking promote 
      maintenance of brain activity in healthy elderly for everyday life but are not 
      sufficient to face the pathologic scenario of excessive synaptic/ neuronal loss 
      as in dementias. It is, then, important to implement techniques that are able to 
      measure changes in normal aging brain and to discriminate the threshold from 
      neurodegenerative processes. Rhythmic electromagnetic brain oscillatory activity 
      is a hallmark of neuronal function and it contains relevant traces of neuronal 
      assemblies cooperation across different brain functions; an integrated approach 
      utilizing modern neurophysiological techniques, including electroencephalography 
      (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS), together with biological markers and structural and functional imaging is 
      promising for largescale, affordable, and non-invasive intercept of at-risk 
      populations both at a group and probably also at a single-subject level. This 
      approach might also guarantee the possibility of studying drug-induced changes in 
      the electrical properties of the human cortex, developing and testing models of 
      brain connectivity and treating neuropsychiatric diseases. In this paper some 
      neurophysiological cutting-edge techniques will be presented that provide 
      innovative information and deal with the broad issue of the role of 
      neurophysiology for the assessment of patho-physiological aging and dementia also 
      providing new insight to the actions of central nervous system drugs at the 
      cortical level.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment of Cortical Excitability in Alzheimer's Dementia and Its 
      Association with Clinical Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses.
PG  - 867-891
LID - 10.3233/JAD-210311 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive and 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) due to underlying neurodegenerative pathology. 
      Some studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have shown increased epileptiform 
      and epileptic activity in AD. OBJECTIVE: This review and meta-analyses aims to 
      synthesize the existing evidence for quantitative abnormalities of cortical 
      excitability in AD and their relationship with clinical symptoms. METHODS: We 
      systematically searched and reviewed publications that quantitatively assessed 
      cortical excitability, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) resting 
      motor threshold (rMT), active motor threshold (aMT), motor evoked potential (MEP) 
      or directly from the cortex using TMS-EEG via TMS-evoked potential (TEP). We 
      meta-analyzed studies that assessed rMT and aMT using random effects model. 
      RESULTS: We identified 895 publications out of which 37 were included in the 
      qualitative review and 30 studies using rMT or aMT were included in the 
      meta-analyses. The AD group had reduced rMT (Hedges' g = -0.99, 95% CI [-1.29, 
      -0.68], p < 0.00001) and aMT (Hedges' g = -0.87, 95% CI [-1.50, -0.24], 
      p < 0.00001) as compared with control groups, indicative of higher cortical 
      excitability. Qualitative review found some evidence of increased MEP amplitude, 
      whereas findings related to TEP were inconsistent. There was some evidence 
      supporting an inverse association between cortical excitability and global 
      cognition. No publications reported on the relationship between cortical 
      excitability and NPS. CONCLUSION: There is strong evidence of increased motor 
      cortex excitability in AD and some evidence of an inverse association between 
      excitability and cognition. Future studies should assess cortical excitability 
      from non-motor areas using TMS-EEG and examine its relationship with cognition 
      and NPS.

      the potential to trump Alzheimer's disease drug development.
PG  - 243-66
LID - 10.3233/JAD-2012-120943 [doi]
AB  - The universal failure of pharmacologic interventions against Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) appears largely due to their inability to get into neurons and the fact that 
      most have a single mechanism-of-action. A non-invasive, neuromodulatory approach 
      against AD has consequently emerged: transcranial electromagnetic treatment 
      (TEMT). In AD transgenic mice, long-term TEMT prevents and reverses both 
      cognitive impairment and brain amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, while TEMT even 
      improves cognitive performance in normal mice. Three disease-modifying and 
      inter-related mechanisms of TEMT action have been identified in the brain: 1) 
      anti-Aβ aggregation, both intraneuronally and extracellularly; 2) mitochondrial 
      enhancement; and 3) increased neuronal activity. Long-term TEMT appears safe in 
      that it does not impact brain temperature or oxidative stress levels, nor does it 
      induce any abnormal histologic/anatomic changes in the brain or peripheral 
      tissues. Future TEMT development in both AD mice and normal mice should involve 
      head-only treatment to discover the most efficacious set of parameters for 
      achieving faster and even greater cognitive benefit. Given the already extensive 
      animal work completed, translational development of TEMT could occur relatively 
      quickly to "proof of concept" AD clinical trials. TEMT's mechanisms of action 
      provide extraordinary therapeutic potential against other neurologic 
      disorders/injuries, such as Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and 
      stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) included both motor and 
      nonmotor symptoms. Previous studies indicated inconsistent results for the 
      therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on 
      motor and depression in PD. The study aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of 
      rTMS with different mode on motor and depression in PD using a meta-analysis. 
      METHODS: Articles published before July 2019 were searched based on the following 
      databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar). The 
      therapeutic effects were assessed by computing the standard mean difference (SMD) 
      and a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The present study indicated that 
      rTMS showed significant therapeutic effects on motor in PD (SMD 2.05, 95% CI 
      1.57-2.53, I = 93.0%, P < .001). Both high-frequency (HF)-rTMS and low-frequency 
      rTMS showed therapeutic effects on motor; stimulation over primary motor cortex 
      (M1), supplementary motor area, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or 
      M1+DLPFC showed therapeutic effects; stimulation during "on" and "off" states 
      showed therapeutic effects; the study showed long-term effect of rTMS on motor in 
      PD. In addition, the study indicated that rTMS showed significant therapeutic 
      effects on depression in PD (SMD 0.80, 95% CI 0.31-1.29, I = 89.1%, P < .001). 
      Stimulation over left DLPFC showed significant therapeutic effects on depression 
      in PD; only HF-rTMS showed therapeutic effects; ages, disease durations, numbers 
      of pulses, and session durations displayed influence on the therapeutic effects 
      of rTMS on depression in PD; the therapeutic effects on depression was long term. 
      However, no significant difference in therapeutic effects on depression were 
      showed between rTMS and oral Fluoxetine (SMD 0.74, 95% CI -0.83 to 2.31, 
      I = 92.5%, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The rTMS showed significant therapeutic effects 
      on motor in PD. HF-rTMS showed a significant positive antidepressive effect in PD 
      only over DLPFC.

TI  - Nonpharmacological, nonsurgical treatments for freezing of gait in Parkinson's 
      disease: A systematic review.
PG  - 204-214
LID - 10.1002/mds.27913 [doi]
AB  - Freezing of gait is a disabling phenomenon that appears in a substantial number 
      of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients as the disease evolves. It is considered to 
      be one of the most relevant contributing factors to worsening of quality of life. 
      Current pharmacological or surgical treatment options have limited efficacy. 
      Thus, alternative nonpharmacological/nonsurgical approaches have emerged in 
      recent years in an attempt to improve quality of life in PD. This systematic 
      review summarizes studies of such therapies over the past 5 years. Thirty-five 
      studies were evaluated by use of a qualitative evaluation, while the 
      methodological quality was assessed using validated tools. According to our 
      results, there appear to be two broad categories of nonpharmacological therapies: 
      those that seek a long-lasting benefit and those that aim to achieve a transient 
      effect to overcome the freezing of gait episode. Among the former, it is possible 
      to differentiate between "passive" therapies, which include transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation, and "active" therapies, 
      which are based on different cognitive or physical training programs. Finally, 
      "transient effect" therapies use different types of cues, such as visual, 
      auditory, or proprioceptive stimuli, to attempt to shift the patient's habitual 
      motor control to a goal-directed one. In conclusion, a broad spectrum of 
      nonpharmacological/nonsurgical approaches for freezing of gait has emerged in 
      recent years with promising results. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement

AB  - With an ever-increasing population of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients 
      worldwide, a noninvasive treatment for AD is needed. In this paper, the 
      application of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulus (rTMS) as a treatment 
      for patients with probable AD is compared to the application of rTMS as a 
      treatment for depression. Comorbidity of depression and dementia is discussed, as 
      well as possible links between the two diseases. The possible confounding 
      antidepressant effects of rTMS on cognitive improvements in AD patients are 
      discussed.

AB  - Patients with Parkinson's disease may develop various non-motor symptoms during 
      the course of the illness. Visual hallucinations (VH) and cognitive impairment 
      (CI) are two common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Studies have 
      reported association of both VH and CI with presence of rapid eye movement sleep 
      behavior disorder (RBD). Presence of visual hallucinations and cognitive 
      impairment has been described as risk factors for emergence of each other. There 
      is marked overlap in the risk factors for development of RBD, VH and CI in 
      patients with PD. Results of clinical and epidemiological studies as well as 
      studies based on neuroimaging, electrophysiology especially transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation and neuropsycholgical evaluations in PD patients have suggested 
      presence of certain common neurobiological process leading to emergence of RBD, 
      VH and CI. Structural neuroimaging studies using voxel-based morphometry have 
      often reported grey matter atrophy of hippocampus and parahippocampal cortices in 
      PD patients with RBD, VH and CI. Cholinergic dysfunction is common in PD patients 
      with RBD, VH and CI. This review explores the complex interactions of RBD, VH and 
      CI in patients with PD and their potential implications.

AB  - Geriatric depression is associated with increased mortality because of suicide 
      and decreases in functional and physical health. Many elders' depression is 
      resistant to psychotherapy and medication and can become chronic. 
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is increasingly used in the treatment of 
      medication-resistant or life-threatening geriatric depression. Neuromodulation 
      therapies (subconvulsive, focal, or subconvulsive and focal) are alternatives for 
      the management of treatment-resistant depression in the elderly. Therapies that 
      combine both strategies could be safer but may not be as effective as ECT. This 
      review covers the evidence on the safety and efficacy of ECT and the 
      neuromodulation therapies in geriatric depression.

TI  - Non-pharmacological treatment for Parkinson disease patients with depression: a 
      meta-analysis of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and 
      cognitive-behavioral treatment.

AB  - Background: Nowadays, antidepressants still are the mainstay of treatment for 
      depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) but some recent studies report that 
      medication might aggravate motor symptoms in PD patients. This meta-analysis aims 
      to assess the effect of non-pharmacological treatments for depression in patients 
      with PD.Materials and Methods: Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were 
      included. The participants were PD patients with comorbid depression (dPD). The 
      interventions had the equivalent effect of non-pharmacological treatments alone 
      compared with control(s). Scores of depression scale were selected as the primary 
      outcome, while scores of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III and 
      the incidence of side effects were the secondary outcome. The statistics were 
      pooled and presented as weighted mean differences (WMDs), standardized mean 
      differences (SMDs), or risk ratios (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs).Results: Fifteen articles were eventually included; twelve studies reported 
      on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and three used cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT). Other interventions failed to have qualified studies. 
      Our data indicated that both rTMS and CBT could significantly improve depression 
      scores in a short term (SMD = -0.621, 95% CI [-0.964, -0.278]; SMD = -1.148, 95% 
      CI [-1.498, -0.798], respectively). In addition, rTMS could alleviate motor 
      symptom (WMD = -2.617, 95% CI [-4.183, -1.051]) and was relatively safe (RR = 
      1.054, 95% CI [0.698, 1.592]).Conclusion: Our data suggest that rTMS can safely 
      alleviate depression and motor symptoms in dPD at least for a short period. 
      Moreover, compared with clinical monitoring, CBT can improve depressive symptoms.

TI  - A review of the effects of hypoxia, sleep deprivation and transcranial magnetic

      Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 501-18
AB  - Different kinds of challenge can alter cognitive process and 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms in humans. This can provide an alternative 
      paradigms to evaluate treatment effects in drug discovery. Here, we report recent 
      findings on the effects of challenges represented by sleep deprivation (SD), 
      transient hypoxia, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy 
      volunteers on cognitive processes and EEG rhythms to build a knowledge platform 
      for novel research for drug discovery in AD Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sleep 
      pressure enhanced frontal delta rhythms (< 4 Hz) during the night, while SD 
      increased slow rhythms in the theta range (4-7 Hz), and reduced resting state 
      alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz) after the following day. Furthermore, SD transiently 
      affected cognitive performance. In contrast, transient experimental hypoxia 
      induced abnormal posterior resting state delta and alpha rhythms in healthy 
      volunteers that resemble the abnormal EEG rhythms typically recorded in AD 
      patients. However, the relationship between the cognitive and EEG effects of such 
      challenges is poorly understood. TMS reversibly interfered with higher brain 
      functions during EEG recordings, but few studies have investigated the 
      relationship between the cognitive and EEG effects of TMS. In conclusion, SD is 
      the most mature challenge model for testing new drugs for AD. Future 
      investigation is needed to better understand the opportunities offered by TMS and 
      hypoxia challenges.

TI  - Mapping human brain activity in vivo.
PG  - 273-8
AB  - A wide range of structural and functional techniques now exists to map the human 
      brain in health and disease. These approaches span the gamut from external 
      tomographic imaging devices (positron-emission tomography, single photon-emission 
      computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography), to surface 
      detectors (electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation), to measurements made directly on the brain's surface or beneath it 
      (intrinsic signal imaging, electrocorticography). The noninvasive methods have 
      been combined to provide unique and previously unavailable insights into the 
      macroscopic organization of the functional neuroanatomy of human vision, 
      sensation, hearing, movement, language, learning, and memory. All methods have 
      been applied to patients with neurologic, neurosurgical, and psychiatric disease 
      and have provided a rapidly expanding knowledge of the pathophysiology of 
      diseases such as epilepsy, cerebrovascular disease, neoplasms, neurodegenerative 
      diseases, mental illness, and addiction states. In addition, these new methods 
      have become a mainstay of preoperative surgical planning and the monitoring of 
      pharmacologic or surgical (transplantation) interventions. Most recently, the 
      ability to observe the reorganization of the human nervous system after acute 
      injury, such as occurs with cerebral infarction or head trauma, or in the course 
      of a progressive degenerative process such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, 
      may provide new insights and methods in the rapidly expanding field of 
      neurorehabilitation. Our newfound ability to generate maps and databases of human 
      brain development, maturation, skill acquisition, aging, and disease states is 
      both an exciting and formidable task.

AB  - Numerous studies over the span of more than a decade have shown that non-invasive 
      brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, namely transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), can facilitate language 
      recovery for patients who have suffered from aphasia due to stroke. While stroke 
      is the most common etiology of aphasia, neurodegenerative causes of language 
      impairment-collectively termed primary progressive aphasia (PPA)-are increasingly 
      being recognized as important clinical phenotypes in dementia. Very limited data 
      now suggest that (NIBS) may have some benefit in treating PPAs. However, before 
      applying the same approaches to patients with PPA as have previously been pursued 
      in patients with post-stroke aphasia, it will be important for investigators to 
      consider key similarities and differences between these aphasia etiologies that 
      is likely to inform successful approaches to stimulation. While both post-stroke 
      aphasia and the PPAs have clear overlaps in their clinical phenomenology, the 
      mechanisms of injury and theorized neuroplastic changes associated with the two 
      etiologies are notably different. Importantly, theories of plasticity in 
      post-stroke aphasia are largely predicated on the notion that regions of the 
      brain that had previously been uninvolved in language processing may take on new 
      compensatory roles. PPAs, however, are characterized by slow distributed 
      degeneration of cellular units within the language system; compensatory 
      recruitment of brain regions to subserve language is not currently understood to 
      be an important aspect of the condition. This review will survey differences in 
      the mechanisms of language representation between the two etiologies of aphasia 
      and evaluate properties that may define and limit the success of different 
      neuromodulation approaches for these two disorders.

AB  - We review the electrophysiological studies concerning the effects of caffeine on 
      muscle, lower and upper motor neuron excitability and cognition. Several 
      different methods have been used, such as electromyography, recruitment analysis, 
      H-reflex, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroencephalography and 
      event-related potentials. The positive effect of caffeine on vigilance, 
      attention, speed of reaction, information processing and arousal is supported by 
      a number of electrophysiological studies. The evidence in favor of an increased 
      muscle fiber resistance is not definitive, but higher or lower motor neuron 
      excitability can occur as a consequence of a greater excitation of the descending 
      input from the brainstem and upper motor neurons. TMS can address the influence 
      of caffeine on the upper motor neuron. Previous studies showed that cortico-motor 
      threshold and intracortical excitatory and inhibitory pathways are not influenced 
      by caffeine. Nonetheless, our results indicate that cortical silent period (CSP) 
      is reduced in resting muscles after caffeine consumption, when stimulating the 
      motor cortex with intensities slightly above threshold. We present new data 
      demonstrating that this effect is also observed in fatigued muscle. We conclude 
      that CSP can be considered a surrogate marker of the effect of caffeine in the 
      brain, in particular of its central ergogenic effect.

AB  - Late-life mental illness is a growing concern. Current medications have limited 
      efficacy and are associated with safety concerns. A variety of brain stimulation 
      approaches offers alternative treatments. We performed a systematic literature 
      search on the efficacy and safety of brain stimulation in late-life mental 
      illnesses, excluding unipolar nonpsychotic depression. Studies on deep brain 
      stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS), and vagal nerve stimulation that enrolled exclusively older 
      adults (≥65 years) or analyzed older adults as a separate group were included. 
      The search identified 1,181 publications, of which 43 met the above inclusion 
      criteria: 24 were related to the treatment of non-unipolar depression (ECT: 21; 
      rTMS: 2; ECT and rTMS: 1), 14 related to dementia (ECT: 7[2 of these studies were 
      also related to depression]; vagal nerve stimulation: 2; rTMS: 4; deep brain 
      stimulation: 1), and 7 to schizophrenia (ECT: 7). These studies reported a high 
      degree of variability in efficacy and safety with promising results in general, 
      particularly in the treatment of dementia and schizophrenia. Most publications 
      were limited by small sample sizes, lack of control conditions, and lack of 
      randomization. Large studies with a randomized controlled design or other designs 
      such as crossover or off-on-off-on are needed. In contrast to the empiric and 
      nonspecific use of ECT, future studies using modalities other than ECT could 
      focus on novel biologically based interventions that target specific circuitry. 
      These interventions could also be combined with other non-brain stimulation 
      treatments for possible synergistic effects.

TI  - Clinical Efficacy of Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Psychiatric and 
      Cognitive Disorders: Protocol for a Systematic Review.
PG  - e45213
LID - 10.2196/45213 [doi]
LID - e45213
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely used noninvasive 
      brain stimulation technique for psychiatric and cognitive disorders. In recent 
      years, deep TMS (dTMS) has shown promise as an enhanced form of TMS able to 
      stimulate deeper brain structures and target broader networks. Various magnetic 
      Hesed-coil (H-coil) designs-a novel feature of dTMS-have been used to stimulate 
      brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of specific psychiatric and 
      cognitive disorders, thereby producing therapeutic effects. Given the novelty of 
      dTMS in psychiatry, little is known about the clinical efficacy of dTMS across 
      psychiatric and cognitive disorders-that is, whether dTMS performs superiorly to 
      sham or control. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we outline a protocol for a systematic 
      review investigating the clinical efficacy of dTMS. The primary objective is to 
      conduct a systematic review of the literature on dTMS for psychiatric and 
      cognitive disorders and, if feasible, a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of 
      active dTMS versus sham/control for psychiatric disorders. Dementia and related 
      cognitive disorders will also be examined. A secondary objective will be to 
      examine subgroup differences (by age, sex, H-coil design, and dTMS parameters 
      [ie, pulses per session, percentage of motor threshold, etc]) to evaluate whether 
      dTMS differentially influences clinical outcomes based on these factors. METHODS: 
      A comprehensive search of the APA PsycINFO, Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases 
      will be conducted using keywords such as "H-coil" and "dTMS." Two authors (AD and 
      MD) will be responsible for screening relevant articles, assessing article 
      eligibility (according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria), and 
      data extraction. All included articles will undergo a quality and risk of bias 
      assessment. Data from included articles will be summarized qualitatively in a 
      systematic review. If a sufficient number of equivalent studies are available, a 
      meta-analysis will be performed to (1) determine the effect of active versus sham 
      dTMS (or another control arm) across psychiatric and cognitive disorders, and (2) 
      examine subgroup effects of clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The preliminary search 
      rendered a total of 1134 articles from the APA PsycINFO, Embase, and MEDLINE 
      databases. After full-text screening, 21 eligible articles remained. One 
      additional article was identified from the references section of an existing 
      systematic review. In total, 22 eligible articles were included. Data extraction 
      and quality of assessment procedures are ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: We will outline 
      the evidence relating to the clinical efficacy of dTMS in various psychiatric and 
      cognitive disorders. The results of the prospective systematic review will 
      provide clinicians with valuable insight into the clinical (ie, participant age, 
      sex, psychiatric or cognitive disorder, etc) and methodological factors (ie, 
      H-coil design, dTMS parameters, etc) which may contribute to dTMS efficacy, and 
      thereby may assist clinicians in their decision to prescribe dTMS for specific 
      psychiatric and cognitive disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42022360066;

AB  - Damage to the human homologue of area MT produces a motion perception deficit 
      similar to that found in the monkey with MT lesions. Even temporary disruption of 
      MT processing with transcranial magnetic stimulation can produce a temporary 
      akinetopsia [127]. Motion perception deficits, however, also are found with a 
      variety of subcortical lesions and other neurologic disorders that can best be 
      described as causing a disconnection within the motion processing stream. The 
      precise role of these subcortical structures, such as the cerebellum, remains to 
      be determined. Simple motion perception, moreover, is only a part of MT function. 
      It undoubtedly has an important role in the perception of depth from motion and 
      stereopsis [112]. Psychophysical studies using aftereffects in normal observers 
      suggest a link between stereo mechanisms and the perception of depth from motion 
      [9-11]. There is even a simple correlation between stereo acuity and the 
      perception of depth from motion [128]. Future studies of patients with cortical 
      lesions will take a closer look at depth perception in association with motion 
      perception and should provide a better understanding of how motion and depth are 
      processed together.

TI  - Impaired brain plasticity as a potential therapeutic target for treatment and 
      prevention of dementia.
PG  - 21-28

AB  - In 2017, it was estimated that close to 50 million people were living with 
      dementia worldwide and this number is expected to double every 20 years. No 
      effective treatment exists yet probably because by the time Alzheimer's dementia 
      (AD) has developed it is too late to intervene. Areas covered: Mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) is a clinical state that typically precedes AD. In MCI, the 
      prefrontal cortex supports compensatory mechanisms that depend on robust synaptic 
      plasticity and that delay progression to AD. This review focuses on novel 
      neurostimulation approaches that could enhance prefrontal cortical plasticity in 
      vivo by enhancing prefrontal cortical plasticity and function in patients with 
      MCI or AD. It also describes novel neurophysiological markers that could function 
      as targets for such approaches. Expert commentary: Targeting synaptic plasticity 
      in patients with early AD or at risk of developing AD could be a promising 
      approach to slow progression or prevent AD.

AB  - Available pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD) have limited 
      effectiveness, are expensive, and sometimes induce side effects. Therefore, 
      alternative or complementary adjuvant therapeutic strategies have gained 
      increasing attention. The development of novel noninvasive methods of brain 
      stimulation has increased the interest in neuromodulatory techniques as potential 
      therapeutic tool for cognitive rehabilitation in AD. In particular, repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS) are noninvasive approaches that induce prolonged functional 
      changes in the cerebral cortex. Several studies have begun to therapeutically use 
      rTMS or tDCS to improve cognitive performances in patients with AD. However, most 
      of them induced short-duration beneficial effects and were not adequately powered 
      to establish evidence for therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, TMS and tDCS 
      approaches, seeking to enhance cognitive function, have to be considered still 
      very preliminary. In future studies, multiple rTMS or tDCS sessions might also 
      interact, and metaplasticity effects could affect the outcome.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) often experience initial 
      hesitation, slowness of movements, decreased balance and impaired standing 
      ability, which can significantly impact their independence. Transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation are two widely used and 
      promising non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) modalities for treating PD. The 
      supplementary motor area (SMA), associated with motor behaviour and processing, 
      has received increasing attention as a potential stimulation target to alleviate 
      PD-related symptoms. However, the data on NIBS over SMA in PD individuals are 
      inconsistent and has not been synthesised. In this article, we will review the 
      evidence for NIBS over SMA in PD individuals and evaluate its efficacy in 
      improving PD function. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: Randomised controlled clinical trials 
      comparing the effects of NIBS and sham stimulation on motor function, activities 
      of daily living and participation for people with PD will be included. A detailed 
      computer-aided search of the literature will be performed from inception to 
      February 2023 in the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Physiotherapy Evidence 
      Database (PEDro), Web of Science (WOS) and The Chinese National Knowledge 
      Infrastructure (CNKI). Two independent reviewers will screen articles for 
      relevance and methodological validity. The PEDro scale will be used to evaluate 
      the risk of bias of selected studies. Data from included studies will be 
      extracted by two independent reviewers through a customised, preset data 
      extraction sheet. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for 
      this systematic review. The study's findings will be presented at scientific 
      meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Systematic review of the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions in people 
      with Lewy body dementia.
PG  - 395-407
LID - 10.1017/S1041610217002010 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACTBackground:Pharmacological interventions for Lewy body dementia (LBD), 
      especially for its non-cognitive symptoms, are limited in their efficacy and 
      tolerability. Clinicians are often uncertain about non-pharmacological 
      interventions and their efficacy in managing cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms 
      of LBD. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review the existing literature on 
      non-pharmacological interventions for people with LBD. METHODS: We carried out a 
      systematic search using six databases. All human studies examining impact of any 
      non-pharmacological intervention on LBD were assessed for cognitive, physical, 
      psychiatric, and quality-of-life outcomes. Study quality was assessed by 
      Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative 
      Studies and the CARE criteria checklist. RESULTS: Prevailing evidence supporting 
      the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions is weak. We screened 1,647 
      papers. Fifteen studies (n = 61) including 11 case reports were found eligible 
      for this systematic review. Interventions and reported outcomes were 
      heterogeneous. Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert 
      reportedly conferred cognitive benefit. Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation have been reported to ameliorate depressive 
      symptoms. Transcranial direct current stimulation was observed to improve 
      attention. Exercise-based interventions reportedly improve various clinically 
      important outcomes. Spaced retrieval memory training and environmental 
      intervention for "mirror sign" have also been reported. CONCLUSIONS: Several 
      non-pharmacological interventions have been studied in LBD. Although evidence 
      supporting their efficacy is not robust, prevailing preliminary evidence and 
      limitations of available pharmacological interventions indicate the need to 
      consider appropriate non-pharmacological interventions, while planning 
      comprehensive care of LBD patients. Larger trials evaluating the efficacy of 
      non-pharmacological interventions for LBD are needed.

AB  - Forty-five years of studies on magnetism and bioelectromagnetics, in our 
      laboratory, are presented. This article is prepared for the d'Arsonval Award 
      Lecture. After a short introduction of our early work on magnetic analog memory, 
      we review and discuss the following topics: (1) Magnetic nerve stimulation and 
      localized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human brain by 
      figure-eight coils; (2) Measurements of weak magnetic fields generated from the 
      brain by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) systems, called 
      magnetoencephalography (MEG), and its application in functional brain studies; 
      (3) New methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the imaging of impedance 
      of the brain, called impedance MRI, and the imaging of neuronal current 
      activities in the brain, called current MRI; (4) Cancer therapy and other medical 
      treatments by pulsed magnetic fields; (5) Effects of static magnetic fields and 
      magnetic control of cell orientation and cell growth; and (6) Effects of radio 
      frequency magnetic fields and control of iron ion release and uptake from and 
      into ferritins, iron cage proteins. These bioelectromagnetic studies have opened 
      new horizons in magnetism and medicine, in particular for brain research and 
      treatment of ailments such as depression, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term effects of multi-site repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation combined with cognitive training (NeuroAD procedure) on 
      cognitive symptoms and apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as part 
      of a 4-year chart review. METHODS: The study included the 30 AD patients who 
      underwent NeuroAD treatment between 2015 and 2019 at our center. The clinical 
      evaluation was based on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer 
      Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and Apathy Inventory (AI). 
      Assessment was performed before treatment (baseline), after an initial 6-week 
      protocol of 30 sessions (M1.5), then 3 months (M3), 1 year (M12), and between 1.5 
      and 4 years (mean 28 months, M28) after treatment initiation. RESULTS: During the 
      first year of follow-up, the AI score improved at all time points (M1.5, M3, M12, 
      p < 0.0001), the ADAS-Cog score improved at the end of the initial procedure 
      (M1.5, p = 0.003) then deteriorated (M12, p = 0.01), while the MMSE score did not 
      change. At final assessment (M28), the AI score was still improved from baseline 
      (p < 0.0001), while the MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores worsened (p < 0.0001). Regarding 
      the ADAS-Cog score, the prolonged improvement at M12 or M28 was correlated with 
      the initial improvement at M1.5. CONCLUSION: The NeuroAD procedure produced 
      long-term improvement in apathy and more general cognitive improvement only in 
      patients who responded well to the initial 6-week protocol. SIGNIFICANCE: Our 
      results suggest long-term beneficial effects of the NeuroAD procedure on apathy, 
      which need to be confirmed in controlled studies. The criteria for predicting a 
      good outcome before starting the procedure remain to be defined.

TI  - Structural Neuroimaging of the Medial Temporal Lobe in Alzheimer's Disease 
      Clinical Trials.
PG  - 581-9
LID - 10.3233/JAD-150226 [doi]
AB  - Atrophy in the medial temporal lobe (MTA) is being used as a criterion to support 
      a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are several structural 
      neuroimaging approaches for quantifying MTA, including semiquantitative visual 
      rating scales, volumetry (3D), planimetry (2D), and linear measures (1D). Current 
      applications of structural neuroimaging in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials 
      (ADCTs) incorporate it as a tool for improving the selection of subjects for 
      enrollment or for stratification, for tracking disease progression, or providing 
      evidence of target engagement for new therapeutic agents. It may also be used as 
      a surrogate marker, providing evidence of disease-modifying effects. However, 
      despite the widespread use of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 
      ADCTs, there are some important challenges and limitations, such as difficulties 
      in the interpretation of results, limitations in translating results into 
      clinical practice, and reproducibility issues, among others. Solutions to these 
      issues may arise from other methodologies that are able to link the results of 
      volumetric MRI from trials with conventional MRIs performed in routine clinical 
      practice (linear or planimetric methods). Also of potential benefit are automated 
      volumetry, using indices for comparing the relative rate of atrophy of different 
      regions instead of absolute rates of atrophy, and combining structural 
      neuroimaging with other biomarkers. In this review, authors present the existing 
      structural neuroimaging approaches for MTA quantification. They then discuss 
      solutions to the limitations of the different techniques as well as the current 
      challenges of the field. Finally, they discuss how the current advances in AD 
      neuroimaging can help AD diagnosis.

TI  - Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation over Prefrontal Cortex on 
      Attention in Psychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/jcm8040416 [doi]
LID - 416
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be effective for 
      enhancing cognitive functioning. In this review, we aimed to systematically 
      evaluate the effects of rTMS on attention in psychiatric diseases. In particular, 
      we searched PubMed and Embase to examine the effectiveness of rTMS administered 
      to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on this specific cognitive domain. 
      The search identified 24 articles, 21 of which met inclusion and exclusion 
      criteria. Among them, nine were conducted in patients with depression, four in 
      patients with schizophrenia, three in patients with autism spectrum disorder 
      (ASD), two in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, one each in 
      patients with Alzheimer's disease and in patients with alcohol or methamphetamine 
      addiction. No evidence for cognitive adverse effects was found in all the 
      included rTMS studies. Several studies showed a significant improvement of 
      attentional function in patients with depression and schizophrenia. The 
      beneficial effects on attention and other executive functions suggest that rTMS 
      has the potential to target core features of ASD. rTMS may influence the 
      attentional networks in alcohol-dependent and other addicted patients. We also 
      reviewed and discussed the studies assessing the effects of rTMS on attention in 
      the healthy population. This review suggests that prefrontal rTMS could exert 
      procognitive effects on attention in patients with many psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) are a common complication in patients with 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). A complex cascade of electrophysiological and molecular 
      events that induce aberrant plasticity in the cortico-basal ganglia system plays 
      a key role in the pathophysiology of LIDs. In the striatum, multiple 
      neurotransmitters regulate the different forms of physiological synaptic 
      plasticity to provide it in a bidirectional and Hebbian manner. In PD, impairment 
      of both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) progresses 
      with disease and dopaminergic denervation of striatum. The altered balance 
      between LTP and LTD processes leads to unidirectional changes in plasticity that 
      cause network dysregulation and the development of involuntary movements. These 
      alterations have been documented, in both experimental models and PD patients, 
      not only in deep brain structures but also at motor cortex. Invasive and 
      non-invasive neuromodulation treatments, as deep brain stimulation, transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation, or transcranial direct current stimulation, may provide 
      strategies to modulate the aberrant plasticity in the cortico-basal ganglia 
      network of patients affected by LIDs, thus restoring normal neurophysiological 
      functioning and treating dyskinesias. In this review, we discuss the evidence for 
      neuroplasticity impairment in experimental PD models and in patients affected by 
      LIDs, and potential neuromodulation strategies that may modulate aberrant 
      plasticity.

TI  - The role of noninvasive brain stimulation for behavioral and psychological 
      symptoms of dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1063-1074
LID - 10.1007/s10072-020-04245-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating and comparing the efficacy of 
      noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques on the behavioral and 
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). METHODS: An exhaustive literature 
      retrieval was performed on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science 
      until October 2019. The primary outcome was the relative changes in BPSD severity 
      scores immediately after NIBS and at the last follow-up visit. Subgroup analyses 
      were conducted to compare the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Changes in 
      the severity scores after NIBS were also analyzed with restriction to patients 
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: Ten studies with 324 patients were 
      included, out of which 7 studies involved patients with AD. The analysis results 
      indicated that NIBS significantly improved the BPSD outcome immediately after 
      stimulation (SMD, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10-0.52; P = 0.005), but not at the last 
      follow-up visit (0.15; - 0.11-0.41; 0.25). Our subgroup analyses suggested that 
      the favorable effects of rTMS remained significant at the last follow-up visit 
      (0.57; 0.18-0.96; 0.004). This discrepancy maybe caused by the continuously 
      insignificant outcomes of tDCS on the whole data. The results for AD patients 
      immediately after stimulation (0.37; 0.12-0.61; 0.003) and at the last follow-up 
      visit (0.29; - 0.19-0.76; 0.24) were both largely similar to those in the whole 
      patient group with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: rTMS, rather than tDCS, was capable of 
      persistently improving the BPSD at an early stage after treatment. More trials 
      are warranted to confirm our results before the establishment of final 
      conclusions.

AB  - It is now possible to probe the plasticity of some neural circuits in the human 
      motor cortex using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This article 
      illustrates how changes in the plasticity of these circuits is linked to the 
      expression of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease, and may even underlie the 
      tendency of some individuals to develop focal dystonia. Indeed, gradual 
      normalisation of this excessive plasticity occurs after initiating deep brain 
      stimulation of the internal globus pallidus in patients with generalised 
      dystonia. It may therefore relate to the slow onset of clinical improvement that 
      occurs over the first 6 weeks or so of treatment.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and 
      cognitive abilities. There is no cure for PD, therefore identifying safe 
      therapies to alleviate symptoms remains a priority. This meta-analysis quantified 
      the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and 
      transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) to improve motor and cognitive 
      dysfunction in PD. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, 
      Library of Congress and Cochrane library were searched. 24 rTMS and 9 TES studies 
      (n = 33) with a sham control group were included for analyses. The Physiotherapy 
      Evidence Database and Cochrane Risk of Bias showed high quality (7.5/10) and low 
      bias with included studies respectively. Our results showed an overall positive 
      effect in favour of rTMS (SMD = 0.394, CI [0.106-0.683], p = 0.007) and TES 
      (SMD = 0.611, CI [0.188-1.035], p = 0.005) compared with sham stimulation on 
      motor function, with no significant differences detected between rTMS and TES (Q 
      [1] = 0.69, p = 0.406). Neither rTMS nor TES improved cognition. No effects for 
      stimulation parameters on motor or cognitive function were observed. To enhance 
      the clinical utility of non-invasive brain stimulation (NBS), individual 
      prescription of stimulation parameters based upon symptomology and resting 
      excitability state should be a priority of future research.

TI  - Motor cortex dysfunction revealed by cortical excitability studies in Parkinson's 
      disease: influence of antiparkinsonian treatment and cortical stimulation.
PG  - 244-53
AB  - Single or paired pulse paradigms of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
      provide several parameters to test motor cortex excitability, such as motor 
      threshold (MT), motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, electromyographic silent 
      period to cortical stimulation (CSP) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) or 
      inhibition (ICI). Various changes in TMS parameters, revealing motor cortex 
      dysfunction, were found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). For instance, 
      low MT and increased MEP size disclosed an enhanced corticospinal motor output at 
      rest, while reduced ICF and failure of MEP size increase during contraction 
      suggested defective facilitatory cortical inputs, particularly for movement 
      execution. Inhibitory cortical pathways were also found less excitable at rest 
      (reduced ICI) and sometimes during contraction (shortened CSP). By restoring 
      cortical inhibition, dopaminergic drugs and deep brain stimulation probably 
      overcome the difficulty to focus neuronal activity onto the appropriate network 
      required for a specific motor task. The application of repetitive TMS trains over 
      motor cortical areas also showed some effect on cortical excitability, opening 
      perspectives to consider the motor cortex as a target for therapeutic 
      neuromodulation in PD. However, systematic studies of cortical excitability 
      remained to be performed in large series of patients with PD, taking into account 
      disease stage, clinical symptoms and medication influence.

LID - V06160433 [pii]
AB  - Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) represents a severe adverse effect of long-term 
      treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa. Neuroimaging studies have 
      contributed to our understanding of LID and may help to identify patients at risk 
      of developing LID. Amantadine can be used for the treatment of LID, and novel 
      drugs are under development. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus 
      and globus pallidus internus alleviates LID, the former indirectly by reducing 
      levodopa intake, the latter through direct effects. Repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation has been shown to transiently improve LID.

AB  - Different kinds of challenge can alter spontaneous ongoing 
      electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms in animal models, thus providing paradigms 
      to evaluate treatment effects in drug discovery. The effects of challenges 
      represented by pharmacological agents, hypoxia, sleep deprivation and 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on EEG rhythms are here reviewed to build 
      a knowledge platform for innovative translational models for drug discovery in 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been reported that antagonists of cholinergic 
      neurotransmission cause synchronisation of spontaneous ongoing EEG rhythms in 
      terms of enhanced power of EEG low frequencies and decreased power of EEG high 
      frequencies. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and serotonergic drugs may restore a 
      normal pattern of EEG desynchronisation. Sleep deprivation and hypoxia challenges 
      have also been reported to elicit abnormal synchronisation of spontaneous ongoing 
      EEG rhythms in rodents. The feasibility and reproducibility of TMS have been 
      demonstrated in rodents but information on a consistent modulation of EEG after 
      TMS manipulation is very limited. Transgenic mice over-expressing human amyloid 
      precursor protein complementary DNAs (cDNAs) harbouring the 'Swedish' mutation 
      and PS-1 cDNAs harbouring the A264E mutation, which recapitulate some of the 
      pathological features of AD, exhibit alterations of spontaneous ongoing EEG 
      rhythms at several low and high frequencies. This does not appear, however, to be 
      a consequence of beta-amyloid deposition in the brain. The present review 
      provides a critical evaluation of changes of spontaneous ongoing EEG rhythms due 
      to the experimental manipulations described above, in order to stimulate the 
      promote more adherent models fitting dynamics in humans.

TI  - The landscape of neurophysiological outcome measures in ALS interventional 
      trials: A systematic review.

LID - S1388-2457(22)00191-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clinph.2022.02.020 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We collated all interventional clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS), which utilised at least one neurophysiological technique as a 
      primary or secondary outcome measure. By identifying the strengths and 
      limitations of these studies, we aim to guide study design in future trials. 
      METHODS: We conducted and reported this systematic review according to the 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. 
      Eight databases were searched from inception. In total, 703 studies were 
      retrieved for screening and eligibility assessment. RESULTS: Dating back to 1986, 
      32 eligible interventional clinical trials were identified, recruiting a median 
      of 30 patients per completed trial. The most widely employed neurophysiological 
      techniques were electromyography, motor unit number estimation (including motor 
      unit number index), neurophysiological index and transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (including resting motor threshold and short-interval intracortical 
      inhibition). Almost 40% of trials reported a positive outcome with respect to at 
      least one neurophysiological measure. The interventions targeted either ion 
      channels, immune mechanisms or neuronal metabolic pathways. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Neurophysiology offers many promising biomarkers that can be utilised as outcome 
      measures in interventional clinical trials in ALS. When selecting the most 
      appropriate technique, key considerations include methodological standardisation, 
      target engagement and logistical burden. SIGNIFICANCE: Future trial design in ALS 
      would benefit from a standardised, updated and easily accessible repository of 
      neurophysiological outcome measures.

AB  - In this article, non-drug methods of treatment of Parkinson's disease are 
      reviewed. Particular attention is given to the motor symptoms of disease, 
      specifically to gait disorders. Information about objective methods of gait 
      impairment is presented. Own results that confirm the effect of a method of 
      tempo-rhythmical correction of walk in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 
      vascular parkinsonism as well as a device for assessment of gait parameters 
      developed by the authors are analyzed. The efficacy of other methods of gait 
      correction using external cues, study design and level of evidence are analyzed 
      as well. Information about possibilities of physical therapy and ergotherapy for 
      correction of different symptoms of Parkinson's disease is presented. Positive 
      and negative results of transcranial magnetic stimulation, light therapy and 
      transcranial micropolarization in PD are analyzed. Basis non-drug methods of PD 
      treatment, which currently have insufficient level of evidence (methods of mental 
      relaxation and auditory training, methods of whole body vibration (vibromassage), 
      laser therapy (photoacoustic therapy), acupuncture), are described in brief. 
      Perspectives of the method of gait recovery in PD using tempo-rhythmic correction 
      are emphasized.

TI  - Clinical neurophysiology of aging brain: from normal aging to neurodegeneration.
PG  - 375-400
AB  - Physiological brain aging is characterized by a loss of synaptic contacts and 
      neuronal apoptosis that provokes age-dependent decline of sensory processing, 
      motor performance, and cognitive function. Neural redundancy and plastic 
      remodelling of brain networking, also secondary to mental and physical training, 
      promotes maintenance of brain activity in healthy elderly for everyday life and 
      fully productive affective and intellectual capabilities. However, age is the 
      main risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      that impact on cognition. Oscillatory electromagnetic brain activity is a 
      hallmark of neuronal network function in various brain regions. Modern 
      neurophysiological techniques including electroencephalography (EEG), 
      event-related potential (ERP), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) can accurately index normal and abnormal brain aging 
      to facilitate non-invasive analysis of cortico-cortical connectivity and neuronal 
      synchronization of firing and coherence of rhythmic oscillations at various 
      frequencies. The present review provides a perspective of these issues by 
      assaying different neurophysiological methods and integrating the results with 
      functional brain imaging findings. It is concluded that discrimination between 
      physiological and pathological brain aging clearly emerges at the group level, 
      with applications at the individual level also suggested. Integrated approaches 
      utilizing neurophysiological techniques together with biological markers and 
      structural and functional imaging are promising for large-scale, low-cost and 
      non-invasive evaluation of at-risk populations. Practical implications of the 
      methods are emphasized.

TI  - Targeting Gamma-Related Pathophysiology in Autism Spectrum Disorder Using 
      Transcranial Electrical Stimulation: Opportunities and Challenges.
PG  - 1051-1071
LID - 10.1002/aur.2312 [doi]
AB  - A range of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities correlates with the 
      core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Among these are alterations of 
      brain oscillations in the gamma-frequency EEG band in adults and children with 
      ASD, whose origin has been linked to dysfunctions of inhibitory interneuron 
      signaling. While therapeutic interventions aimed to modulate gamma oscillations 
      are being tested for neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, 
      Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia, the prospects for therapeutic 
      gamma modulation in ASD have not been extensively studied. Accordingly, we 
      discuss gamma-related alterations in the setting of ASD pathophysiology, as well 
      as potential interventions that can enhance gamma oscillations in patients with 
      ASD. Ultimately, we argue that transcranial electrical stimulation modalities 
      capable of entraining gamma oscillations, and thereby potentially modulating 
      inhibitory interneuron circuitry, are promising methods to study and mitigate 
      gamma alterations in ASD. Autism Res 2020, 13: 1051-1071. © 2020 International 
      Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Brain functions 
      are mediated by various oscillatory waves of neuronal activity, ranging in 
      amplitude and frequency. In certain neuropsychiatric disorders, such as 
      schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, reduced high-frequency oscillations in the 
      "gamma" band have been observed, and therapeutic interventions to enhance such 
      activity are being explored. Here, we review and comment on evidence of reduced 
      gamma activity in ASD, arguing that modalities used in other disorders may 
      benefit individuals with ASD as well.

TI  - Neuroprotection trek--the next generation: neuromodulation I. Techniques--deep 
      brain stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, and transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation.
PG  - 1-13; discussion 48-53
AB  - Neuromodulation denotes controlled electrical stimulation of the central or 
      peripheral nervous system. The three forms of neuromodulation described in this 
      paper-deep brain stimulation, vagus nerve stimulation, and transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation-were chosen primarily for their demonstrated or potential clinical 
      usefulness. Deep brain stimulation is a completely implanted technique for 
      improving movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, by very focal 
      electrical stimulation of the brain-a technique that employs well-established 
      hardware (electrode and pulse generator/battery). Vagus nerve stimulation is 
      similar to deep brain stimulation in being well-established (for the treatment of 
      refractory epilepsy), completely implanted, and having hardware that can be 
      considered standard at the present time. Vagus nerve stimulation differs from 
      deep brain stimulation, however, in that afferent stimulation of the vagus nerve 
      results in diffuse effects on many regions throughout the brain. Although use of 
      deep brain stimulation for applications beyond movement disorders will no doubt 
      involve placing the stimulating electrode(s) in regions other than the thalamus, 
      subthalamus, or globus pallidus, the use of vagus nerve stimulation for 
      applications beyond epilepsy-for example, depression and eating disorders-is 
      unlikely to require altering the hardware significantly (although stimulation 
      protocols may differ). Transcranial magnetic stimulation is an example of an 
      external or non-implanted, intermittent (at least given the current state of the 
      hardware) stimulation technique, the clinical value of which for neuromodulation 
      and neuroprotection remains to be determined.

TI  - Comparisons between traditional medicines and pharmacotherapies for Alzheimer 
      disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive outcomes.
PG  - 449-458

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical evidence for traditional medicines (TMs) 
      used in East Asia on measures of cognition in Alzheimer disease, determine the 
      effect sizes at different time points for the TMs and pharmacotherapies, and 
      assess the tolerability of the TMs. METHODS: We searched 12 databases in English, 
      Chinese, and Japanese for eligible randomised controlled trials that compared 
      orally administered TMs with pharmacotherapy and reported cognitive outcomes. 
      Meta-analyses were conducted for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive 
      subscale and/or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Mean differences and 95% 
      confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate treatment effects. RESULTS: 
      Thirty randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine compared 
      TMs with donepezil. Single studies provided comparisons with galantamine, 
      rivastigmine, or memantine. There were no significant differences between the TM 
      and donepezil groups at 12 or 24 weeks for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
      Scale-cognitive subscale or MMSE. Improvements over baseline were significant for 
      MMSE at 12 and 24 weeks within the TM and donepezil groups and remained 
      significant at 1 year. Effect sizes were reduced in the 3 double-blind studies. 
      At 24 weeks, donepezil 10 mg/d generally produced greater improvements in MMSE 
      than 5 mg/d. Tolerability reporting was incomplete and inconsistent between 
      studies. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the clinical benefits of the TMs 
      were not less than donepezil at comparable time points, with both groups showing 
      improvements. However, lack of blinding in most studies and other design and 
      measurement issues are likely to have resulted in overestimation of effect sizes 
      in both groups. Further well-designed studies are needed.

TI  - Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields stimulation modulates autoimmunity 
      and immune responses: a possible immuno-modulatory therapeutic effect in 
      neurodegenerative diseases.
PG  - 1888-1895
LID - 10.4103/1673-5374.195277 [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence shows that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields 
      (ELF-EMFs) stimulation is able to exert a certain action on autoimmunity and 
      immune cells. In the past, the efficacy of pulsed ELF-EMFs in alleviating the 
      symptoms and the progression of multiple sclerosis has been supported through 
      their action on neurotransmission and on the autoimmune mechanisms responsible 
      for demyelination. Regarding the immune system, ELF-EMF exposure contributes to a 
      general activation of macrophages, resulting in changes of autoimmunity and 
      several immunological reactions, such as increased reactive oxygen 
      species-formation, enhanced phagocytic activity and increased production of 
      chemokines. Transcranial electromagnetic brain stimulation is a non-invasive 
      novel technique used recently to treat different neurodegenerative disorders, in 
      particular Alzheimer's disease. Despite its proven value, the mechanisms through 
      which EMF brain-stimulation exerts its beneficial action on neuronal function 
      remains unclear. Recent studies have shown that its beneficial effects may be due 
      to a neuroprotective effect on oxidative cell damage. On the basis of in vitro 
      and clinical studies on brain activity, modulation by ELF-EMFs could possibly 
      counteract the aberrant pro-inflammatory responses present in neurodegenerative 
      disorders reducing their severity and their onset. The objective of this review 
      is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature on EMFs and 
      outline the most promising effects of ELF-EMFs in developing treatments of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. In this regard, we review data supporting the role 
      of ELF-EMF in generating immune-modulatory responses, neuromodulation, and 
      potential neuroprotective benefits. Nonetheless, we reckon that the underlying 
      mechanisms of interaction between EMF and the immune system are still to be 
      completely understood and need further studies at a molecular level.

TI  - Do studies on cortical plasticity provide a rationale for using non-invasive 
      brain stimulation as a treatment for Parkinson's disease patients?
PG  - 180
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2013.00180 [doi]
LID - 180
AB  - Animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) have shown that key mechanisms of 
      cortical plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression 
      (LTD) can be impaired by the PD pathology. In humans protocols of non-invasive 
      brain stimulation, such as paired associative stimulation (PAS) and theta-burst 
      stimulation (TBS), can be used to investigate cortical plasticity of the primary 
      motor cortex. Through the amplitude of the motor evoked potential these 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation methods allow to measure both LTP-like and 
      LTD-like mechanisms of cortical plasticity. So far these protocols have reported 
      some controversial findings when tested in PD patients. While various studies 
      described evidence for reduced LTP- and LTD-like plasticity, others showed 
      different results, demonstrating increased LTP-like and normal LTD-like 
      plasticity. Recent evidence provided support to the hypothesis that these 
      different patterns of cortical plasticity likely depend on the stage of the 
      disease and on the concomitant administration of l-DOPA. However, it is still 
      unclear how and if these altered mechanisms of cortical plasticity can be taken 
      as a reliable model to build appropriate protocols aimed at treating PD symptoms 
      by applying repetitive sessions of repetitive TMS (rTMS) or transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS). The current article will provide an up-to-date 
      overview of these issues together with some reflections on future studies in the 
      field.

TI  - [Indications for electroconvulsive therapy].
PG  - 889-93
LID - 10.1016/j.lpm.2008.01.009 [doi]
AB  - Curative electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains a very useful treatment, still 
      irreplaceable for some specific rare cases, as long as other brain stimulation 
      methods, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, remain experimental. ECT must 
      be preceded by a rigorous evaluation of its therapeutic index, based on its 
      advantages and risks compared with other potential treatments, in view of the 
      patient's medical and psychiatric history. The principal indication is very 
      severe depressive illness. In view of its efficacy and speed of action, ECT may 
      be a first-line treatment for life-threatening depression and a second line 
      treatment for patients with major depressive disorder who do not respond or 
      respond incompletely to antidepressant drugs. ECT can be given to patients with 
      catatonia, including as first-line treatment for some. ECT remains an important 
      treatment option for depression in the elderly, especially those with depression 
      and reversible dementia. Other indications classically considered, although for 
      fewer patients and never as first-line treatment, are difficult-to-treat patients 
      whose acute mania, mixed mania, schizo-affective state or schizophrenia has 
      failed to respond to an adequate dose of psychotropic drugs and can be considered 
      drug-refractory. It has also been used in Parkinson's psychosis and 
      drug-resistant epilepsy. Preventive or maintenance ECT is appropriate for a few 
      depressed patients who respond to it and it alone. It is the only effective 
      option for these severely and recurrently depressed, medication-resistant 
      patients. Some technical issues remain very empirical: seizure threshold 
      determination, number of sessions, and concomitant pharmacotherapy. The practice 
      of ECT must comply with very strict rules: information to and consent by the 
      patient or family, performance at a hospital center by a team including a 
      psychiatrist, anesthetist, and trained nurses.

TI  - Treatment of depression in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - S37-41
AB  - Depression is an important and common nonmotor feature of Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) that is associated with significant disability and a negative impact on 
      quality of life. The physician should remain vigilant for symptoms of depression 
      as they may be mistaken for the progression of Parkinson's disease itself. 
      Transient dysphoria that occurs during 'off' periods in fluctuating PD patients 
      must be distinguished from true depression. Antidepressant therapy should be 
      instituted if depression is interfering with the patient's daily function. The 
      use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants in the 
      treatment of depression in PD is widespread in clinical practice. Dopamine 
      agonists may be effective in the treatment of milder depression as well. 
      Individual or family counseling may be helpful. In patients with severe 
      depression who are refractory to antidepressant medications, a series of 
      electroconvulsive treatments can be lifesaving. Nonconventional therapies such as 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation are being investigated.

      Cognition and Brain Integrity.

AB  - Sports are yielding a wealth of benefits for cardiovascular fitness, for 
      psychological resilience, and for cognition. The amount of practice, and the type 
      of practiced sports, are of importance to obtain these benefits and avoid any 
      side effects. This is especially important in the context of contact sports. 
      Contact sports are not only known to be a major source of injuries of the 
      musculoskeletal apparatus, they are also significantly related to concussion and 
      sub-concussion. Sub-concussive head impacts accumulate throughout the active 
      sports career, and thus can cause measurable deficits and changes to brain 
      health. Emerging research in the area of cumulative sub-concussions in contact 
      sports has revealed several associated markers of brain injury. For example, 
      recent studies discovered that repeated headers in soccer not only cause 
      measurable signs of cognitive impairment but are also related to a prolonged 
      cortical silent period in transcranial magnetic stimulation measurements. Other 
      cognitive and neuroimaging biomarkers are also pointing to adverse effects of 
      heading. A range of fluid biomarkers completes the picture of cumulating effects 
      of sub-concussive impacts. Those accumulating effects can cause significant 
      cognitive impairment later in life of active contact sportswomen and men. The aim 
      of this review is to highlight the current scientific evidence on the effects of 
      repeated sub-concussive head impacts on contact sports athletes' brains, identify 
      the areas in need of further investigation, highlight the potential of advanced 
      neuroscientific methods, and comment on the steps governing bodies have made to 
      address this issue. We conclude that there are indeed neural and biofluid markers 
      that can help better understand the effects of repeated sub-concussive head 
      impacts and that some aspects of contact sports should be redefined, especially 
      in situations where sub-concussive impacts and concussions can be minimized.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation: 
      treatments for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the neurodegenerative 
      dementias?
PG  - 74
LID - 10.1186/s13195-014-0074-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Two methods of non-invasive brain stimulation, transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), 
      have demonstrable positive effects on cognition and can ameliorate 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression. Less is known about the efficacy of 
      these approaches in common neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we 
      evaluate the effects of TMS and tDCS upon cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms 
      in the major dementias, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia 
      (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), 
      and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as well as the potential pre-dementia states 
      of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: PubMed 
      (until 7 February 2014) and PsycINFO (from 1967 to January Week 3 2014) databases 
      were searched in a semi-systematic manner in order to identify relevant treatment 
      studies. A total of 762 studies were identified and 32 studies (18 in the 
      dementias and 14 in PD populations) were included. RESULTS: No studies were 
      identified in patients with PDD, FTD or VaD. Of the dementias, 13 studies were 
      conducted in patients with AD, one in DLB, and four in MCI. A total of 16 of the 
      18 studies showed improvements in at least one cognitive or neuropsychiatric 
      outcome measure. Cognitive or neuropsychiatric improvements were observed in 12 
      of the 14 studies conducted in patients with PD. CONCLUSIONS: Both TMS and tDCS 
      may have potential as interventions for the treatment of symptoms associated with 
      dementia and PD. These results are promising; however, available data were 
      limited, particularly within VaD, PDD and FTD, and major challenges exist in 
      order to maximise the efficacy and clinical utility of both techniques. In 
      particular, stimulation parameters vary considerably between studies and are 
      likely to subsequently impact upon treatment efficacy.

TI  - Degeneration of the cholinergic system in individuals with subjective cognitive 
      decline: A systematic review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a risk factor for future 
      cognitive impairment and dementia. It is uncertain whether the neurodegeneration 
      of the cholinergic system is already present in SCD individuals. We aimed to 
      review the current evidence about the association between SCD and biomarkers of 
      degeneration in the cholinergic system. METHOD: Original articles were extracted 
      from three databases: Pubmed, Web of Sciences, and Scopus, in January 2023. Two 
      researchers screened the studies independently. RESULTS: A total of 11 research 
      articles were selected. SCD was mostly based on amnestic cognitive complaints. 
      Cholinergic system biomarkers included neuroimaging markers of basal forebrain 
      volume, functional connectivity, transcranial magnetic stimulation, or biofluid. 
      The evidence showed associations between basal forebrain atrophy, poorer 
      connectivity of the cholinergic system, and SCD CONCLUSIONS: Degenerative changes 
      in the cholinergic system can be present in SCD. Subjective complaints may help 
      when identifying individuals with brain changes that are associated with 
      cognitive impairment. These findings may have important implications in targeting 
      individuals that may benefit from cholinergic-target treatments at very early 
      stages of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Frontotemporal dementia is more frequently diagnosed because of revised 
      diagnostic procedures. Due to the lack of pharmacological trials it is a disease 
      that is difficult to manage in the way of evidence based medicine. Deficits in 
      serotonergic and dopaminergic signal-transmission are well known. The cholinergic 
      system does not seem to be affected. Case reports and clinical trials show a 
      benefit by using antidepressants, neuroleptics and mood stabilizers. Nevertheless 
      only paroxetine, trazodone and rivastigmine are tested by double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled studies. While paroxetine shows inconsistent data, trazodone 
      improves behavioural symptoms. Patients report a treatment-emergent adverse 
      effect including fatigue, dizziness and hypotension. Rivastigmine leads to a 
      significant decrease in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Score. Finally, we present 
      a two-cases-report that shows improve of disease symptoms under treatment with 
      repetitive transcranial magnet stimulation.

TI  - Technology insight: noninvasive brain stimulation in neurology-perspectives on 
      the therapeutic potential of rTMS and tDCS.
PG  - 383-93
AB  - In neurology, as in all branches of medicine, symptoms of disease and the 
      resulting burden of illness and disability are not simply the consequence of the 
      injury, inflammation or dysfunction of a given organ; they also reflect the 
      consequences of the nervous system's attempt to adapt to the insult. This plastic 
      response includes compensatory changes that prove adaptive for the individual, as 
      well as changes that contribute to functional disability and are, therefore, 
      maladaptive. In this context, brain stimulation techniques tailored to modulate 
      individual plastic changes associated with neurological diseases might enhance 
      clinical benefits and minimize adverse effects. In this Review, we discuss the 
      use of two noninvasive brain stimulation techniques--repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation--to modulate 
      activity in the targeted cortex or in a dysfunctional network, to restore an 
      adaptive equilibrium in a disrupted network for best behavioral outcome, and to 
      suppress plastic changes for functional advantage. We review randomized 
      controlled studies, in focal epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, recovery from stroke, 
      and chronic pain, to illustrate these principles, and we present evidence for the 
      clinical effects of these two techniques.

AB  - Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS) have been proposed as a new therapeutic way to enhance 
      the cognition of patients with dementia. However, serious methodological 
      limitations appear to affect the estimates of their efficacy. We reviewed the 
      stimulation parameters and methods of studies that used TMS or tDCS to alleviate 
      the cognitive symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI). Moreover, we evaluated the risk of bias in these 
      studies. Our aim was to highlight the current vulnerabilities of the field and to 
      formulate recommendations on how to manage these issues when designing studies. 
      Methods: Electronic databases and citation searching were used to identify 
      studies administering TMS or tDCS on patients with AD or MCI to enhance cognitive 
      function. Data were extracted by one review author into summary tables with the 
      supervision of the authors. The risk of bias analysis of randomized-controlled 
      trials was conducted by two independent assessors with version 2 of the Cochrane 
      risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Results: Overall, 36 trials were 
      identified of which 23 randomized-controlled trials underwent a risk of bias 
      assessment. More than 75% of randomized-controlled trials involved some levels of 
      bias in at least one domain. Stimulation parameters were highly variable with 
      some ranges of effectiveness emerging. Studies with low risk of bias indicated 
      TMS to be potentially effective for patients with AD or MCI while questioned the 
      efficacy of tDCS. Conclusions: The presence and extent of methodical issues 
      affecting TMS and tDCS research involving patients with AD and MCI were examined 
      for the first time. The risk of bias frequently affected the domains of the 
      randomization process and selection of the reported data while missing outcome 
      was rare. Unclear reporting was present involving randomization, allocation 
      concealment, and blinding. Methodological awareness can potentially reduce the 
      high variability of the estimates regarding the effectiveness of TMS and tDCS. 
      Studies with low risk of bias delineate a range within TMS parameters seem to be 
      effective but question the efficacy of tDCS.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation as an Alternative Therapy for 
      Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 463-72
LID - 10.3233/JAD-150346 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have indicated that repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS) could improve cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). Yet the results are inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis 
      aimed to evaluate recent rTMS studies conducted in mild to moderate AD patients. 
      METHODS: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE databases and Science Direct were searched for 
      studies of rTMS treatment on AD patients with cognitive impairment published 
      before February 2015. The relevant primary outcomes of cognition were extracted 
      from those included studies. A crude standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) was calculated by using random effect models. RESULTS: 
      Seven studies with a total of 94 mild to moderate AD patients were included in 
      this meta-analysis. A significant overall rTMS treatment effect on cognition was 
      found for all AD patients (p = 0.0008, SMD = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.41-1.58). 
      Stratification analysis showed that this effect is stimulation frequency- and 
      hemisphere-dependent. High frequency stimulation (>1.0 Hz) (p <  0.05) but not 
      low frequency stimulation (≤1.0 Hz) (p >  0.05) was significantly effective in 
      improving the cognition of AD patients. Further, rTMS stimulation on right 
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral DLPFC (p <  0.05), but not 
      on the left DLPFC (p >  0.05) was significantly effective in improving cognitive 
      function of AD patients. A significant effect was observed in the rTMS subgroup 
      (p <  0.05), rather than in the rTMS+drug subgroup (p >  0.05). CONCLUSION: This 
      meta-analysis supports that high frequency rTMS stimulation on right- or 
      bilateral-DLPFC has significant therapeutic effect on cognitive function in 
      patients with mild to moderate AD. Due to small number of studies included, more 
      well-controlled rTMS studies should be evaluated in AD patients in the future.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective clinical 
      intervention for various neuropsychiatric diseases. However, it is still unclear 
      whether rTMS has an effect on cognitive functioning. In this review, we aimed to 
      systematically evaluate the cognitive effects of rTMS in depression, 
      schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. We searched PubMed (1996-2018) under the 
      set terms to review randomized controlled trials (RCT) to examine the 
      effectiveness of rTMS administered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) 
      and evaluated cognitive functions in patients with depression, schizophrenia, and 
      Alzheimer's disease. Two authors reviewed each article and came to consensus on 
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All eligible studies were reviewed, 
      duplicates were removed, and data were extracted individually. The search 
      identified 579 articles, 31 of which met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among 
      them, 15 were conducted in patients with depression, 11 in patients with 
      schizophrenia, and 5 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, 6 
      studies demonstrated a significant improvement of executive function across these 
      diseases. Further, no evidence for cognitive adverse effects was found in these 
      included rTMS studies. Although the heterogeneity between studies in terms of 
      cognitive measures applied, stimulation parameters, and participants limits the 
      ability to generalize conclusions, this review demonstrated that prefrontal rTMS 
      could exert pro-cognitive effects on executive function and attention in some 
      patients with depression but inconsistent cognitive impacts in any of the 
      examined domains especially in patients with schizophrenia and Alzheimer's 
      disease. The results warrant further rTMS studies that include systematic 
      assessment of cognition across various neuropsychiatric diseases.

TI  - Depression in Parkinson's disease. Pharmacological characteristics and treatment.
PG  - 55-74
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurological illness and various degrees of 
      depression frequently complicate its course. Risk factors for developing 
      depression with PD include right-sided hemiparkinsonism, akinesia, increased 
      severity of disability, anxiety and psychosis. Onset of parkinsonism at a younger 
      age, female gender and the use of levodopa are arguable risk factors. Depression 
      may be difficult to diagnose in patients with PD because the signs of the 2 
      disorders overlap. In addition, patients with atypical PD more commonly have 
      depression than patients with classical PD presentations. Antidepressant response 
      to antiparkinsonian treatment has been limited. Enhancement of catecholamine 
      levels in the CNS by selegiline (deprenyl), a monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B 
      inhibitor, has shown potential antidepressant as well as neuroprotective effects. 
      Other MAO inhibitors have shown antidepressant efficacy in animal models but have 
      not been well tolerated by patients with PD. A catechol-O-methyltransferase 
      (COMT) inhibitor combined with an MAO inhibitor might synergistically maximise 
      the levels of catecholamines in the CNS. Antidepressant medications used in 
      patients without PD include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective 
      serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but only TCAs 
      have been carefully studied for their antidepressant effects in PD. 
      Electroconvulsive therapy has proven efficacy as antidepressant therapy in 
      patients with PD, and transcranial magnetic stimulation has provided temporary 
      relief of depression under experimental conditions. Adverse effects of 
      polypharmacy in the attempted treatment of depression in patients with PD are 
      common in the elderly. A 'serotonin syndrome' has occurred frequently enough to 
      preclude the coadministration of selegiline with SSRIs or TCAs, and multiple 
      interactions between antiparkinsonian and antidepressant medications further 
      complicate treatment strategies in patients with PD. An algorithmic approach to 
      the pharmacological treatment of depression is described in this article.

TI  - The modulation effect of non-invasive brain stimulation on cognitive function in 
      patients with mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      randomized controlled trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent and control dementia, many scholars have focused on the 
      transition stage between normal ageing and dementia, mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI) which is a key interventional target for dementia. Studies have shown that 
      non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is beneficial to improve cognitive function 
      of MCI patients. However, whether NIBS is conducive to the protection of 
      cognitive ability in MCI patients remains unknown due to limited evidence. The 
      aim of the study was to systematically evaluate the modulation effect of NIBS on 
      cognitive function (global cognitive ability and specific domains of cognition) 
      in patients with MCI. RESULTS: A total of 11 RCTs comprising a total of 367 MCI 
      participants. Meta-analysis showed that NIBS can significantly improve global 
      cognition (n = 271, SMD = 0.94, 95% CI 0.47-1.41, p < 0.0001) and verbal fluency 
      (n = 72, MD = 2.03, 95% CI 0.17-3.88, p = 0.03). However, there was no 
      significant improvement in other domains of cognition. CONCLUSIONS: NIBS has a 
      positive effect on improving global cognitive function and verbal fluency. At the 
      same time, it has a small positive effect on improving executive function. 
      However, these findings should be interpreted carefully due to the limitations of 
      the study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychopharmacotherapy currently constitutes the first-line treatment 
      for depression and anxiety in Parkinson's disease (PD) however the efficacy of 
      antidepressant treatments in PD is unclear. Several alternative treatments have 
      been suggested as potentially more viable alternatives including dopamine 
      agonists, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and cognitive behavioural 
      therapy (CBT). METHOD: A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials 
      for depression and/or anxiety in PD was conducted to systematically examine the 
      efficacy of current treatments for depression and anxiety in PD. RESULTS: Nine 
      trials were included. There was only sufficient data to calculate a pooled effect 
      for antidepressant therapies. The pooled effect of antidepressants for depression 
      in PD was moderate but non-significant (d = .71, 95% CI = -1.33 to 3.08). The 
      secondary effect of antidepressants on anxiety in PD was large but also 
      non-significant (d = 1.13, 95% CI = -.67 to 2.94). Two single-trials of 
      non-pharmacological treatments for depression in PD resulted in significant large 
      effects; Omega-3 supplementation (d = .92, 95% CI = .15 to 1.69) and CBT (d = 
      1.57, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.07), and warrant further exploration. CONCLUSIONS: There 
      remains a lack of controlled trials for both pharmacological and 
      non-pharmacological treatments for depression and anxiety in PD which limits the 
      conclusions which can be drawn. While the pooled effects of antidepressant 
      therapies in PD were non-significant, the moderate to large magnitude of each 
      pooled effect is promising. Non-pharmacological approaches show potential for 
      depression in PD however more research is required.

TI  - Gamma Band Neural Stimulation in Humans and the Promise of a New Modality to 
      Prevent and Treat Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 363-392

AB  - Existing treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have questionable efficacy with 
      a need for research into new and more effective therapies to both treat and 
      possibly prevent the condition. This review examines a novel therapeutic modality 
      that shows promise for treating AD based on modulating neuronal activity in the 
      gamma frequency band through external brain stimulation. The gamma frequency band 
      is roughly defined as being between 30 Hz-100 Hz, with the 40 Hz point being of 
      particular significance. The epidemiology, diagnostics, existing pathological 
      models, and related current treatment targets are initially briefly reviewed. 
      Next, the concept of external simulation triggering brain activity in the gamma 
      band with potential demonstration of benefit in AD is introduced with reference 
      to a recent important study using a mouse model of the disease. The review then 
      presents a selection of relevant studies that describe the neurophysiology 
      involved in brain stimulation by external sources, followed by studies involving 
      application of the modality to clinical scenarios. A table summarizing the 
      results of clinical studies applied to AD patients is also reported and may aid 
      future development of the modality. The use of a therapy based on modulation of 
      gamma neuronal activity represents a novel non-invasive, non-pharmacological 
      approach to AD. Although use in clinical scenarios is still a relatively recent 
      area of research, the technique shows good signs of efficacy and may represent an 
      important option for treating AD in the future.

TI  - Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of depression in older adults: A report 
      from the Japanese Society of mood disorders.
PG  - 222-234
LID - 10.1111/pcn.13349 [doi]
AB  - The Committee for Treatment Guidelines of Mood Disorders, Japanese Society of 
      Mood Disorders, published a Japanese guideline for the treatment of late-life 
      depression in 2020. Based on that guideline, the present guideline was developed 
      and revised to incorporate the suggestions of global experts and the latest 
      published evidence. In the diagnosis of late-life depression, it is important to 
      carefully differentiate it from bipolar disorders, depressive states caused by 
      physical and organic brain disease, drug effects, and dementia, and to determine 
      the comorbidity between late-life depression and dementia. It is necessary to 
      fully understand the clinical characteristics and psychosocial background of 
      late-life depression, evaluate the patient's condition, and provide basic 
      interventions based on these factors. Problem-solving therapy, reminiscence 
      therapy/life review therapy, and behavioral activation therapy, and other forms 
      of psychotherapy can reduce depressive symptoms. In terms of pharmacotherapy, 
      newer antidepressants or non-tricyclic antidepressants are recommended for 
      late-life depression, and it is recommended that the efficacy of least the 
      minimal effective dosage should first be determined. Switching antidepressants 
      and aripiprazole augmentation can be used to treatment-resistant therapy. 
      Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation have 
      demonstrated usefulness for late-life depression. Exercise therapy, 
      high-intensity light therapy, and diet therapy also show some effectiveness and 
      are useful for late-life depression. Continuation therapy should be maintained 
      for at least 1 year after remission.

AB  - In our constantly changing environment, we are frequently faced with altered 
      circumstances requiring generation and monitoring of appropriate strategies, when 
      novel plans of action must be formulated and conducted. The abilities that we 
      call upon to respond accurately to novel situations are referred to as 'executive 
      functions', and are frequently engaged to deal with conditions in which routine 
      activation of behavior would not be sufficient for optimal performance. Here, we 
      summarize important findings that may help us understand executive functions and 
      their underlying neuronal correlates. We focus particularly on observations from 
      imaging technology, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, position 
      emission tomography, diffusion tensor imaging, and transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation, which in the past few years have provided the bulk of information on 
      the neurobiological underpinnings of the executive functions. Further, emphasis 
      will be placed on recent insights from Parkinson's disease (PD), in which the 
      underlying dopaminergic abnormalities have provided new exciting information into 
      basic molecular mechanisms of executive dysfunction, and which may help to 
      disentangle the cortical/subcortical networks involved in executive processes.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that a complex, distributed neural network underpins 
      semantic cognition. This article reviews our contribution to this emerging 
      picture and traces the putative roles of each region within this network. 
      Neuropsychological studies indicate that semantic cognition draws on at least two 
      interacting components: semantic representations [degraded in semantic dementia 
      (SD)] and control processes [deficient in patients with multimodal semantic 
      impairment following stroke aphasia (SA)]. To explore the first component, we 
      employed distortion-corrected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy volunteers: these studies 
      convergently indicated that the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs; atrophied in SD) 
      combine information from different modalities within an amodal semantic "hub". 
      Regions of cortex that code specific semantic features ("spokes") also make a 
      critical contribution to knowledge within particular categories. This network of 
      brain regions interacts with semantic control processes reliant on left inferior 
      frontal gyrus (LIFG), posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) and inferior 
      parietal cortices. SA patients with damage to these regions have difficulty 
      focussing on aspects of knowledge that are relevant to the current goal or 
      context, in both verbal and non-verbal tasks. SA patients with LIFG and 
      temporoparietal lesions show similar deficits of semantic control, suggesting 
      that a large-scale distributed cortical network underpins semantic control. 
      Convergent evidence is again provided by fMRI and TMS. We separately manipulated 
      the representational and control demands of a semantic task in fMRI, and found a 
      dissociation within the temporal lobe: ATL was sensitive to the number of 
      meanings retrieved, while pMTG and LIFG showed effects of semantic selection. 
      Moreover, TMS to LIFG and pMTG produced equal disruption of tasks tapping 
      semantic control. The next challenges are to delineate the specific roles of each 
      region within the semantic control network and to specify the way in which 
      control processes interact with semantic representations to focus processing on 
      relevant features of concepts.

AB  - Neurodegenerative processes of various types of dementia start years before 
      symptoms, but the presence of a "neural reserve", which continuously feeds and 
      supports neuroplastic mechanisms, helps the aging brain to preserve most of its 
      functions within the "normality" frame. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an 
      intermediate stage between dementia and normal brain aging. About 50% of MCI 
      subjects are already in a stage that is prodromal-to-dementia and during the 
      following 3 to 5 years will develop clinically evident symptoms, while the other 
      50% remains at MCI or returns to normal. If the risk factors favoring 
      degenerative mechanisms are modified during early stages (i.e., in the 
      prodromal), the degenerative process and the loss of abilities in daily living 
      activities will be delayed. It is therefore extremely important to have 
      biomarkers able to identify-in association with neuropsychological 
      tests-prodromal-to-dementia MCI subjects as early as possible. MCI is a large 
      (i.e., several million in EU) and substantially healthy population; therefore, 
      biomarkers should be financially affordable, largely available and non-invasive, 
      but still accurate in their diagnostic prediction. Neurodegeneration initially 
      affects synaptic transmission and brain connectivity; methods exploring them 
      would represent a 1st line screening. Neurophysiological techniques able to 
      evaluate mechanisms of synaptic function and brain connectivity are attracting 
      general interest and are described here. Results are quite encouraging and 
      suggest that by the application of artificial intelligence (i.e., 
      learning-machine), neurophysiological techniques represent valid biomarkers for 
      screening campaigns of the MCI population.

AB  - Recent studies have reported enhanced performance on language tasks induced by 
      non-invasive brain stimulation, i.e., repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation (rTMS), or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), in 
      patients with aphasia due to stroke or Alzheimer's disease (AD). The first part 
      of this article reviews brain stimulation studies related to language recovery in 
      aphasic patients. The second part reports results from a pilot study with three 
      chronic stroke patients who had non-fluent aphasia, where real or placebo rTMS 
      was immediately followed by 25 minutes of individualised speech therapy. Real 
      rTMS consisted of high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal 
      cortex (BA 8/9) for 25 minutes. Each patient underwent a total of four weeks of 
      intervention. P1 underwent four weeks of real rTMS (5 days/week) where 
      individualised speech therapy was provided for 25 minutes immediately following 
      each rTMS session. P2 and P3 each underwent two weeks of placebo rTMS, followed 
      immediately by individualised speech therapy; then two weeks of real rTMS, 
      followed immediately by individualised speech therapy. Assessments took place at 
      2, 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks post-entry/baseline testing. Relative to entry/baseline 
      testing, a significant improvement in object naming was observed at all testing 
      times, from two weeks post-intervention in real rTMS plus speech therapy, or 
      placebo rTMS plus speech therapy. Our findings suggest beneficial effects of 
      targeted behavioural training in combination with brain stimulation in chronic 
      aphasic patients. However, further work is required in order to verify whether 
      optimal combination parameters (rTMS alone or speech therapy alone) and length of 
      rTMS treatment may be found.

AB  - Synaptic plasticity is the ability of synaptic connections between neurons to be 
      strengthened or weakened; a process that is central to the information processing 
      within the brain and which plays a particularly important role in enabling higher 
      cognitive processes [1,2]. Its role in disease is becoming increasingly clear 
      across a wide spectrum of CNS disorders. Thus, for example, dysfunctional 
      synaptic plasticity has been reported in neurodegenerative disorders such as 
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as well as in schizophrenia and in a range of disorders 
      associated with learning disabilities [3]. Moreover, maladaptive plasticity 
      processes in response to specific external challenges are believed to underlie 
      disorders such as addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 
      molecular basis of normal and disease plasticity is rapidly being unravelled such 
      that synaptic plasticity now provides a unique platform from which to launch the 
      hunt for highly innovative drugs to treat CNS disease by either, firstly, 
      rectifying identifiable abnormalities in these processes, or secondly, utilizing 
      these processes as a vehicle to rectify, or bypass, other mechanisms underlying 
      disease. In this respect, recent advances have been made in studying synaptic 
      plasticity in humans at the molecular through to clinical level and these 
      approaches now provide a real opportunity to test synaptic plasticity as a 
      treatment paradigm for a wide variety of CNS disorders.

TI  - Unlocking the Potential of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in 
      Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials to Optimize 
      Intervention Strategies.
PG  - 481-503
LID - 10.3233/JAD-231031 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an advanced 
      and noninvasive technology that uses pulse stimulation to treat cognitive 
      impairment. However, its specific effects have always been mixed with those of 
      cognitive training, and the optimal parameter for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      intervention is still ambiguous. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to summarize the 
      therapeutic effects of pure rTMS on AD, excluding the influence of cognitive 
      training, and to develop a preliminary rTMS treatment plan. METHODS: Between 1 
      January 2010 and 28 February 2023, we screened randomized controlled clinical 
      trials from five databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, and 
      ClinicalTrials. gov). We conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review of 
      treatment outcomes and rTMS treatment parameters. RESULT: A total of 4,606 
      articles were retrieved. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 
      articles, comprising 655 participants (308 males and 337 females), were included 
      in the final analysis. The findings revealed that rTMS significantly enhances 
      both global cognitive ability (p = 0.0002, SMD = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.20-0.66) and 
      memory (p = 0.009, SMD = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.09-0.65). Based on follow-up periods of 
      at least 6 weeks, the following stimulation protocols have demonstrated efficacy 
      for AD: stimulation sites (single or multiple targets), frequency (20 Hz), 
      stimulation time (1-2 s), interval (20-30 s), single pulses (≤2500), total pulses 
      (>20000), duration (≥3 weeks), and sessions (≥20). CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      suggests that rTMS may be an effective treatment option for patients with AD, and 
      its potential therapeutic capabilities should be further developed in the future.

AB  - Brain stimulation for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases has been used 
      for more than 50 years. Although its development has been slow, current advances 
      in the techniques of brain stimulation have improved its clinical efficacy. The 
      use of non-invasive brain stimulation has significant advantages, such as not 
      involving surgical procedures and having relatively mild adverse effects. In this 
      paper we briefly review the use of 2 non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, 
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct 
      current stimulation (tDCS), as therapeutic approaches in physical and 
      rehabilitation medicine. We also compare the effects of non-invasive central 
      nervous system stimulation with techniques of non-invasive peripheral electrical 
      stimulation, in order to provide new insights for future developments. Although 
      the outcomes of these initial trials include some conflicting results, the 
      evidence supports that rTMS and tDCS might have a therapeutic value in different 
      neurological conditions. Studies published within the last year have examined new 
      approaches of stimulation, such as longer intensities of stimulation, new 
      electrode sizes for tDCS, novel coils for stimulation of deeper areas, and new 
      frequencies of stimulation for rTMS. These new approaches need to be tested in 
      larger clinical trials in order to determine whether they offer significant 
      clinical effects.

TI  - Treatment of late-life depression: a role of non-invasive brain stimulation 
      techniques.
PG  - 437-44

AB  - Late-life depression (LLD) is a frequent complication of the ageing process, 
      occurring in up to 5% of community-dwelling elderly and in a higher proportion of 
      subjects with coexistent medical illnesses. Its presence has been consistently 
      associated with cognitive impairment, greater disability and increased mortality. 
      Approximately half of patients with LLD have evidence of subcortical ischaemic 
      damage in prefrontal circuits revealed by MRI. This might constitute the 
      biological substrate of the cardinal symptoms of depression and of executive 
      dysfunction. An important proportion of patients with LLD do not achieve 
      remission of their depressive symptoms in spite of adequate pharmacological and 
      psychotherapeutic treatment. In addition, a group of LLD patients progress to 
      further impairment and disability in the form of a dementing disorder. There is 
      an imperative need to develop new treatment strategies for LLD. Non-invasive 
      brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are safe and 
      efficacious interventions that might be used in combination with other 
      therapeutic options to improve treatment outcomes. However, there are still 
      questions regarding the optimal way in which rTMS and dTCS should be delivered as 
      well as to the way in which we may identify the subjects who will benefit the 
      most from these interventions.

      treatment: Current insights and future challenges.

AB  - The visual network is crucially implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. 
      Several lines of evidence indicate that migraine is characterized by an altered 
      visual cortex excitability both during and between attacks. Visual symptoms, the 
      most common clinical manifestation of migraine aura, are likely the result of 
      cortical spreading depression originating from the extrastriate area V3A. 
      Photophobia, a clinical hallmark of migraine, is linked to an abnormal sensory 
      processing of the thalamus which is converged with the non-image forming visual 
      pathway. Finally, visual snow is an increasingly recognized persistent visual 
      phenomenon in migraine, possibly caused by increased perception of subthreshold 
      visual stimuli. Emerging research in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has 
      vastly developed into a diversity of areas with promising potential. One of its 
      clinical applications is the single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (sTMS) applied over the occipital cortex which has been approved for treating 
      migraine with aura, albeit limited evidence. Studies have also investigated other 
      NIBS techniques, such as repetitive TMS (rTMS) and transcranial direct current 
      stimulation (tDCS), for migraine prophylaxis but with conflicting results. As a 
      dynamic brain disorder with widespread pathophysiology, targeting migraine with 
      NIBS is challenging. Furthermore, unlike the motor cortex, evidence suggests that 
      the visual cortex may be less plastic. Controversy exists as to whether the same 
      fundamental principles of NIBS, based mainly on findings in the motor cortex, can 
      be applied to the visual cortex. This review aims to explore existing literature 
      surrounding NIBS studies on the visual system of migraine. We will first provide 
      an overview highlighting the direct implication of the visual network in 
      migraine. Next, we will focus on the rationale behind using NIBS for migraine 
      treatment, including its effects on the visual cortex, and the shortcomings of 
      currently available evidence. Finally, we propose a broader perspective of how 
      novel approaches, the concept of brain networks and the integration of multimodal 
      imaging with computational modeling, can help refine current NIBS methods, with 
      the ultimate goal of optimizing a more individualized treatment for migraine.

AB  - Major depression is common in older adults (≥ 60 years of age), termed late-life 
      depression (LLD). Up to 30% of these patients will have treatment-resistant 
      late-life depression (TRLLD), defined as depression that persists despite two 
      adequate antidepressant trials. TRLLD is challenging for clinicians, given 
      several etiological factors (eg, neurocognitive conditions, medical 
      comorbidities, anxiety, and sleep disruption). Proper assessment and management 
      is critical, as individuals with TRLLD often present in medical settings and 
      suffer from cognitive decline and other marks of accelerated aging. This article 
      serves as an evidence-based guide for medical practitioners who encounter TRLLD 
      in their practice.

TI  - Exploring the potential of combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and 
      electroencephalography to investigate mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's 
      disease: a systematic review.
LID - 10.1007/s11357-024-01075-6 [doi]
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) are 
      non-invasive techniques used for neuromodulation and recording brain electrical 
      activity, respectively. The integration of TMS-EEG has emerged as a valuable tool 
      for investigating the complex mechanisms involved in age-related disorders, such 
      as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). By 
      systematically synthesizing TMS-EEG studies, this review aims to shed light on 
      the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying MCI and AD, while also exploring the 
      practical applications of TMS-EEG in clinical settings. PubMed, ScienceDirect, 
      and PsychInfo were selected as the databases for this review. The 22 eligible 
      studies included a total of 592 individuals with MCI or AD as well as 301 
      cognitively normal adults. TMS-EEG assessments unveiled specific patterns of 
      corticospinal excitability, plasticity, and brain connectivity that distinguished 
      individuals on the AD spectrum from cognitively normal older adults. Moreover, 
      the TMS-induced EEG features were observed to be correlated with cognitive 
      performance and the presence of AD pathological biomarkers. The comprehensive 
      examination of the existing studies demonstrates that the combination of TMS and 
      EEG has yielded valuable insights into the neurophysiology of MCI and AD. This 
      integration shows great potential for early detection, monitoring disease 
      progression, and anticipating response to treatment. Future research is of 
      paramount importance to delve into the potential utilization of TMS-EEG for 
      treatment optimization in individuals with MCI and AD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Over the last few years, deep brain stimulation techniques, with 
      targets such as the subthalamic nucleus or the pallidum, have bee found to be 
      beneficial in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Conversely, 
      therapeutic strategies of cortical stimulation have not yet been validated in 
      these diseases, although they are known to be associated with various cortical 
      dysfunctions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a valuable tool for 
      non-invasive study of the role played by the motor cortex in the pathophysiology 
      of movement disorders, in particular by assessing various cortical excitability 
      determinants using single or paired pulse paradigms. In addition, repetitive TMS 
      (rTMS) trains can be used to study the effects of transient activity changes of a 
      targeted cortical area. BACKGROUND: Studies with TMS revealed significant motor 
      cortex excitability changes, particularly regarding intracortical inhibitory 
      pathways, both in Parkinson's disease and in dystonia, and these changes can be 
      distinguished owing to the resting state or to the phases of movement preparation 
      or execution. However, more specific correlation between electrophysiological 
      features and clinical symptoms remains to be established. In addition, the 
      stimulation of various cortical targets by rTMS protocols applied at low or high 
      frequencies have induced some clear clinical effects. PERSPECTIVES: The TMS 
      effects are and will remain applied in movement disorders to better understand 
      the role played by the motor cortex, to assess various types of treatment and 
      appraise the therapeutic potential of cortical stimulation. CONCLUSION: TMS 
      provides evidence for motor cortex dysfunction in Parkinson's disease or 
      dystonia. Moreover, rTMS results have opened new perspectives for therapeutic 
      strategies of implanted cortical stimulation. By these both aspects, TMS 
      techniques show their usefulness in the assessment of movement disorders.

AB  - Non-pharmacological intervention of memory difficulties in healthy older adults, 
      as well as those with brain damage and neurodegenerative disorders, has gained 
      much attention in recent years. The two main reasons that explain this growing 
      interest in memory rehabilitation are the limited efficacy of current drug 
      therapies and the plasticity of the human central nervous and the discovery that 
      during aging, the connections in the brain are not fixed but retain the capacity 
      to change with learning. Moreover, several studies have reported enhanced 
      cognitive performance in patients with neurological disease, following 
      non-invasive brain stimulation [i.e., repetitive transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation to specific cortical 
      areas]. The present review provides an overview of memory rehabilitation in 
      individuals with mild cognitive impairment and in patients with Alzheimer's 
      disease with particular regard to cognitive rehabilitation interventions focused 
      on memory and non-invasive brain stimulation. Reviewed data suggest that in 
      patients with memory deficits, memory intervention therapy could lead to 
      performance improvements in memory, nevertheless further studies need to be 
      conducted in order to establish the real value of this approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review randomized controlled trials that evaluate 
      the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on 
      rehabilitation aspects related to communication and swallowing functions. 
      METHODS: A search was conducted on PubMed, Clinical Trials, Cochrane Library, and 
      ASHA electronic databases. Studies were judged according to the eligibility 
      criteria and analyzed by 2 independent and blinded researchers. RESULTS: We 
      analyzed 9 studies: 4 about aphasia, 3 about dysphagia, 1 about dysarthria in 
      Parkinson's disease and 1 about linguistic deficits in Alzheimer's disease. All 
      aphasia studies used low-frequency rTMS to stimulate Broca's homologous area. 
      High-frequency rTMS was applied over the pharyngoesophageal cortex from the left 
      and/or right hemisphere in the dysphagia studies and over the left dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex in the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's studies. Two aphasia and all 
      dysphagia studies showed a significant improvement of the disorder, compared to 
      the sham group. The other 2 studies related to aphasia found a benefit restricted 
      to subgroups with a severe case or injury on the anterior portion of the language 
      cortical area, respectively, whereas the Alzheimer's study demonstrated positive 
      effects specific to auditory comprehension. There were no changes for vocal 
      function in the Parkinson's study. CONCLUSION: The benefits of the technique and 
      its applicability in neurogenic disorders related to communication and 
      deglutition are still uncertain. Therefore, other randomized controlled trials 
      are needed to clarify the optimal stimulation protocol for each disorder studied 
      and its real effects.

TI  - [Neurophysiology of corticobasal degeneration].
PG  - 779-91
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of 
      mid- to late-adult life. From a clinical standpoint, CBD is characterized by (i) 
      an insidious onset and a slowly progressing, unilateral, levodopa-unresponsive 
      parkinsonian syndrome with dystonia or myoclonus and (ii) cerebral features such 
      as apraxia, alien limb phenomena and cortical sensory loss. Decisive clinical 
      diagnostic criteria are not available and thus a neuropathological study remains 
      essential for accurate CBD diagnosis. Consequently, additional non-clinical 
      criteria must be identified in order to improve diagnosis while patients are 
      still alive. BACKGROUND: Electrophysiological exploration can yield functional 
      information on a number of brain structures (both cortical and sub-cortical) 
      involved in CBD. The disorder features a specific cortical (frontoparietal) 
      alteration which could help with differential diagnoses for other extrapyramidal 
      syndromes. Hence, exploration of a patient's myoclonus can provide some specific 
      arguments for CBD. Indeed, myoclonus displays a number of clinical and 
      electromyographical characteristics which are consistent with a cortical origin 
      (a shorter latency of the cortical C response, for example). However, some 
      typical cortical features are missing (giant somesthesic evoked potentials, and 
      cortical potentials preceding myoclonus in jerk-locked back-averaging studies). 
      Some authors explain these abnormalities in terms of a sub-cortical origin for 
      the myoclonus. The frontoparietal alteration in CBD has also been explored in 
      studies of oculomotor movement. Indeed, asymmetric lengthening of the lateral 
      ocular saccade latency argues more in favour of CBD than progressive supranuclear 
      palsy. Moreover, cognitive function is also compromised in the early stages of 
      CBD, although it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between CBD, PSP and 
      frontotemporal dementia. Studying cognitive potentials enables one to confirm 
      subcorticofrontal abnormalities and to dissociate CBD patterns from PSP patterns. 
      Other electrophysiological tests (such as the exploration of dysautonomia, the 
      palmomental reflex and the blink reflex) produce results which overlap with those 
      seen in extrapyramidal syndromes and synucleinopathies (polysomnography), 
      prompting discussion of the physiopathological mechanisms of these various 
      diseases. CONCLUSION: Electrophysiological exploration is of value for diagnosing 
      CBD in general and for studying specific, frontoparietal dysfunctions in 
      particular. These techniques could also significantly contribute to our 
      understanding of the physiopathology of CBD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder of tongue, jawbone, 
      trunk and/or limbs that may appear after a prolonged use of dopamine receptor 
      blocking agents (after 3 months of treatment or after 1 month for patients over 
      60), and that are present during at least four consecutive weeks. TD is a 
      frequent side effect of both classical neuroleptics and new generation 
      antipsychotic drugs. The prevalence of iatrogenic TD is between 24 and 32 % after 
      treatment with classical neuroleptics and about 13 % after treatment with a new 
      generation antipsychotic. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents an updated literature 
      review of data on diagnosis, prevention and treatment of TD. METHODS: We 
      conducted a review of literature using the Medline Browser tool, screening 
      studies from 1950 to 2013 in English or French with keywords « tardive 
      dyskinesia », « tardive dystonia », and « abnormal movements caused by 
      antipsychotic drugs ». RESULTS: We first describe and define semeiological 
      features of TD: dystonia, tremor, myoclonus, acathisie, chorea, ballism and 
      athetosia. Secondarily, we resume the main differential diagnoses to exclude when 
      confronted with this kind of movement disorders. Differential diagnoses for 
      dyskinesia can be classified between primary (Parkinson and Huntington diseases) 
      and secondary (Wilson disease, intoxication, metabolic abnormality, 
      cerebrovascular accident) abnormal movements. Psychogenic TD can be evocated if 
      previous pathologies are excluded in case of atypical clinical presentation. We 
      detail the risk factors for TD. Endogenous risk factors are related to the 
      patient's age, underlying psychiatric disease (bipolar disorder or Alzheimer 
      dementia), addiction to alcohol or cocaine, female gender, or neurodevelopmental 
      vulnerability. Iatrogenic risk factors are high doses of antipsychotics, long or 
      intermittent administration, and particular pharmaceutical classes or 
      associations of antipsychotics. As a comprehensive tool, we review the main 
      physiopathological hypotheses to explain the occurrence of TD in some patients: 
      hypersensitivity of D2 neuronal receptor or neurotoxicity associated with 
      oxidative stress mechanisms. We also summarize the current guidelines for 
      prevention and treatment of TD. Three successive curative strategies are 
      suggested in the literature. First, the clinician can adapt the current 
      antipsychotic treatment (switch to a new generation antipsychotic, diminution or 
      cessation of antipsychotic drugs). If this first intervention is not pertinent or 
      ineffective, the clinician can prescribe an antikinetic therapeutic agent, such 
      as tetrabenazine, or an antioxidant. Review of the published studies does not 
      show proof of efficacy of cholinergic or anticholinergic drugs, benzodiazepine or 
      other GABAergic drugs, nor for amantadine. Non-medication therapeutics such as 
      ECT and TMS are discussed, but the level of proof is insufficient to promote them 
      as a curative treatment for TD. In case of high resistance and discomfort for the 
      patient, a neurosurgical intervention should be discussed. These curative 
      interventions are limited, emphasising the importance of TD prevention, by 
      limiting the prescription and doses of antipsychotics, regularly evaluating their 
      side effects and informing the patient of TD's risk. CONCLUSION: We propose to 
      practitioners a synthesised update of literature concerning a frequent iatrogenic 
      effect of antipsychotics. Nevertheless, no solid guidelines have as yet been 
      established, and further clinical studies are expected in order to better 
      understand this frequent and discomforting side effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The cerebellum is involved in the pathophysiology of many movement 
      disorders and its importance in the field of neuromodulation is growing. 
      OBJECTIVES: To review the current evidence for cerebellar modulation in movement 
      disorders and its safety profile. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified after 
      a systematic literature review of the effects of cerebellar modulation in 
      cerebellar ataxia, Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremor (ET), dystonia and 
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Neuromodulation techniques included 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation 
      (tDCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The changes in motor scores and the 
      incidence of adverse events after the stimulation were reviewed. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-four studies were included in the systematic review, comprising 431 
      patients. The evaluation after stimulation ranged from immediately after to 12 
      months after. Neuromodulation techniques improved cerebellar ataxia due to 
      vascular or degenerative etiologies (TMS, tDCS and DBS), dyskinesias in PD 
      patients (TMS), gross upper limb movement in PD patients (tDCS), tremor in ET 
      (TMS and tDCS), cervical dystonia (TMS and tDCS) and dysarthria in PSP patients 
      (TMS). All the neuromodulation techniques were safe, since only three studies 
      reported the existence of side effects (slight headache after TMS, local skin 
      erythema after tDCS and infectious complication after DBS). Eleven studies did 
      not mention if adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebellar modulation can 
      improve specific symptoms in some movement disorders and is a safe and 
      well-tolerated procedure. Further studies are needed to lay the groundwork for 
      new researches in this promising target.

AB  - Stroke is the main cause of motoric and neuropsychological disability in adults. 
      Recent advances in research into the role of the brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor in neuroplasticity, neuroprotection and neurogenesis might provide 
      important information for the development of new poststroke-rehabilitation 
      strategies. It plays a role as a mediator in motor learning and rehabilitation 
      after stroke. Concentrations of BDNF are lower in acute ischemic-stroke patients 
      compared to controls. Lower levels of BDNF are correlated with an increased risk 
      of stroke, worse functional outcomes and higher mortality. BDNF signalling is 
      dependent on the genetic variation which could affect an individual's response to 
      recovery after stroke. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms of the BDNF gene 
      have been studied with regard to stroke patients, but most papers analyse the 
      rs6265 which results in a change from valine to methionine in the precursor 
      protein. Subsequently a reduction in BDNF activity is observed. There are studies 
      indicating the role of this polymorphism in brain plasticity, functional and 
      morphological changes in the brain. It may affect the risk of ischemic stroke, 
      post-stroke outcomes and the efficacy of the rehabilitation process within 
      physical exercise and transcranial magnetic stimulation. There is a consistent 
      trend of Met alleles' being connected with worse outcomes and prognoses after 
      stroke. However, there is no satisfactory data confirming the importance of Met 
      allele in stroke epidemiology and the post-stroke rehabilitation process. We 
      present the current data on the role of BDNF and polymorphisms of the BDNF gene 
      in stroke patients, concentrating on human studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the use of noninvasive functional imaging and "virtual" 
      lesion techniques to study the neural mechanisms underlying motor speech 
      disorders in Parkinson's disease. Here, we report the use of positron emission 
      tomography (PET) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explain 
      exacerbated speech impairment following subthalamic nucleus deep brain 
      stimulation (STN-DBS) in a patient with Parkinson's disease. METHOD: Perceptual 
      and acoustic speech measures, as well as cerebral blood flow during speech as 
      measured by PET, were obtained with STN-DBS on and off. TMS was applied to a 
      region in the speech motor network found to be abnormally active during DBS. 
      Speech disruption by TMS was compared both perceptually and acoustically with 
      speech produced with DBS on. RESULTS: Speech production was perceptually inferior 
      and acoustically less contrastive during left STN stimulation compared to no 
      stimulation. Increased neural activity in left dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) was 
      observed during DBS on. "Virtual" lesioning of this region resulted in speech 
      characterized by decreased speech segment duration, increased pause duration, and 
      decreased intelligibility. CONCLUSIONS: This case report provides evidence that 
      impaired speech production accompanying STN-DBS may result from unintended 
      activation of PMd. Clinical application of functional imaging and TMS may lead to 
      optimizing the delivery of STN-DBS to improve outcomes for speech production as 
      well as general motor abilities.

TI  - Concurrent exergaming and transcranial direct current stimulation to improve 
      balance in people with Parkinson's disease: study protocol for a randomised 
      controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People with Parkinson's disease (PD) commonly experience postural 
      instability, resulting in poor balance and an increased risk of falls. 
      Exercise-based video gaming (exergaming) is a form of physical training that is 
      delivered through virtual reality technology to facilitate motor learning and is 
      efficacious in improving balance in aged populations. In addition, studies have 
      shown that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS), when applied 
      to the primary motor cortex, can augment motor learning when combined with 
      physical training. However, no studies have investigated the combined effects of 
      exergaming and tDCS on balance in people with PD. METHODS/DESIGN: Twenty-four 
      people with mild to moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr scale score 2-4) will be randomly 
      allocated to receive one of three interventions: (1) exergaming + a-tDCS, (2) 
      exergaming + sham a-tDCS or (3) usual care. Participants in each exergaming group 
      will perform two training sessions per week for 12 weeks. Each exergaming session 
      will consist of a series of static and dynamic balance exercises using a 
      rehabilitation-specific software programme (Jintronix) and 20 minutes of either 
      sham or real a-tDCS (2 mA) delivered concurrently. Participants allocated to 
      usual care will be asked to maintain their normal daily physical activities. All 
      outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and at 6 weeks (mid-intervention), 
      12 weeks (post-intervention) and 24 weeks (3-month follow-up) after baseline. The 
      primary outcome measure will be the Limits of Stability Test. Secondary outcomes 
      will include measures of static balance, leg strength, functional capacity, 
      cognitive task-related cortical activation, corticospinal excitability and 
      inhibition, and cognitive inhibition. DISCUSSION: This will be the first trial to 
      target balance in people with PD with combined exergaming and a-tDCS. We 
      hypothesise that improvements in balance, functional and neurophysiological 
      outcome measures, and neurocognitive outcome measures will be greater and 
      longer-lasting following concurrent exergaming and a-tDCS than in those receiving 
      sham tDCS or usual care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical

AB  - The functional abnormalities of the central motor structures and its contribution 
      of rigidity, tremor and bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease seem mainly due to 
      the degeneration of the nigro-striatal pathway. Transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      (TMS) of the motor cortex may provide useful data on the pathophysiology of motor 
      dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Recent reviews on the basic mechanisms of TMS 
      in Parkinson's disease show reduced inhibitory motor network at the cortical and 
      spinal level. The observed changes are thought to be in relation with a 
      dysfunction of subcortico-cortical and subcortico-spinal pathways. The 
      abnormalities of the central motor function seem to be modified by several 
      clinical related factors as prevalence of cardinal Parkinson's disease signs 
      (e.g. rigidity versus tremor or bradykinesia), L-dopa therapy ('on/off' states) 
      and laterality of the Parkinson's disease signs. Observations made using TMS give 
      new pathophysiological insights in functioning of the central motor structures in 
      Parkinson's disease and started new form of TMS - repetitive TMS (rTMS) as a 
      treatment of the Parkinson's disease motor signs. A few studies using rTMS with 
      repetition rate of 0.2, 1, and 5 Hz showed improvement of motor signs in the 
      Parkinson's disease patients. Although these results support the beneficial 
      effects of rTMS on parkinsonian symptoms, long-term studies with large numbers of

TI  - Projections from basal ganglia to tegmentum: a subcortical route for explaining 
      the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease signs?
PG  - II75-81
AB  - Functional changes in the organisation of neuronal circuitries are generally used 
      to explain parkinsonian motor symptoms and levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Based on 
      information from histology and neurophysiological microrecordings of specific 
      basal ganglia nuclei, the most widely accepted scheme is based on a central loop 
      which starts in the cerebral cortex, makes multiple relays in the basal ganglia, 
      and returns to the cerebral cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, 
      however, reveal no significant differences in the excitability of the motor 
      cortex between normal subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. 
      Furthermore, electrophysiological and audiospinal facilitation studies indicate 
      that the activity of reticular nuclei is altered in Parkinson's disease. It 
      therefore appears that a circuit with the cortex as the only recipient of basal 
      ganglia output is an oversimplification. This paper explores the relationships 
      between various basal ganglia nuclei and proposes a subcortical pathway via which 
      modifications in the basal ganglia may influence motor function.

TI  - Interhemispheric inhibition in different phenotypes of progressive supranuclear 
      palsy.
PG  - 453-61
LID - 10.1007/s00702-012-0879-7 [doi]
AB  - Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is the most common atypical parkinsonian 
      syndrome and an important differential diagnosis of parkinson's disease (PD). The 
      clinical diagnosis of PSP relies on characteristic symptoms. There is evidence of 
      clinical subgroups within the entity of PSP interfering with making the firm 
      diagnosis. It was the aim of the study to clarify the differences between 
      phenotypical subtypes of PSP and PD focusing on transcallosal inhibition (TI). A 
      systematic chart review of 67 patients supposed to have probable PSP was done in 
      a standardized diagnostic work-up. As only complete data sets were included into 
      further analysis, 26 PSP patients (mean age 68.6 ± 7.1 years) could be evaluated 
      and subdivided into Richardson's syndrome (RS) (n = 15) or PSP of parkinsonian 
      type (PSP-P) (n = 11). Fifteen PD patients served as controls. TI was evaluated 
      by investigation of the ipsilateral silent period (iSP) with transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS). Cognition was assessed by the Addenbrooke's cognitive 
      examination (ACE-R). TMS revealed a significantly more severe affection of TI in 
      RS patients as compared to PSP-P and PD patients who showed similar 
      neurophysiological findings. 47 % of RS patient displayed an iSP loss, whereas 
      PSP-P and PD did not. There was a significant correlation between iSP latency and 
      ACE-R (Spearman's coefficient -0.369, P = 0.010). In conclusion, RS 
      patients-contrary to PSP-P and PD patients-had pathological TI at least in one 
      hemisphere indicating more severe involvement of transcallosally projecting 
      output neurons in RS.

TI  - Processes of beta-amyloid and intracellular cytoplasmic domain generation by 
      presenilin/gamma-secretase.
PG  - 160-2
LID - 10.1159/000113690 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Following extracellular shedding, transmembrane domains (TMs) of 
      beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) and Notch-1 undergo proteolysis by 
      presenilin (PS)/gamma-secretase at least at two sites, near the middle of the TM 
      (gamma-/S4 cleavage) and at the interface between cytosol and the TM (epsilon-/S3 
      cleavage), releasing Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated beta-amyloid 
      (Abeta)/Notch-1beta (Nbeta) and betaAPP intracellular cytoplasmic domain 
      (AICD)/Notch-1 intracellular cytoplasmic domain (NICD). Inhibiting 
      PS/gamma-secretase activity is an essential approach to AD treatment, but it also 
      decreases NICD production, which may cause severe side effects. Therefore, it is 
      important to investigate the differences between the cleavages at the two sites. 
      Gamma-/S4 and epsilon-cleavages have diversity, and produce a number of 
      Abeta/Nbeta and AICD species. S3 cleavage diversity has been recently identified. 
      It is significant that each cleavage occurs with strict precision, not randomly. 
      METHODS: Biochemical analysis of cultured cells was performed to explore the 
      processing mechanisms. RESULTS: Familial AD-associated PS1 mutations as well as a 
      subset of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause similar changes in gamma-/S4 
      cleavage precision, suggesting a common process for these cleavages near the 
      middle of the TM. While the precision of the epsilon-cleavage is drastically 
      affected by physiological factors, that of epsilon-/S3 cleavage is not. 
      CONCLUSION: The processes of the two cleavages occurring in different portions of 
      TMs may be diverse, thus representing possible targets for anti-AD therapeutics 
      to selectively reduce Abeta.

PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1743-0003-6-4 [doi]
AB  - There has been considerable interest in trialing NBS in a range of neurological 
      conditions, and in parallel the range of NBS techniques available continues to 
      expand. Underpinning this is the idea that NBS modulates neuroplasticity and that 
      plasticity is an important contributor to functional recovery after brain injury 
      and to the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. However while the evidence 
      for neuroplasticity and its varied mechanisms is strong, the relationship to 
      functional outcome is less clear and the clinical indications remain to be 
      determined. To be maximally effective, the application of NBS techniques will 
      need to be refined to take into account the diversity of neurological symptoms, 
      the fundamental differences between acute, longstanding and chronic progressive 
      disease processes, and the differential part played by functional and 
      dysfunctional plasticity in diseases of the brain and spinal cord.

TI  - Time perception impairs sensory-motor integration in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/1755-7682-6-39 [doi]
AB  - It is well known that perception and estimation of time are fundamental for the 
      relationship between humans and their environment. However, this temporal 
      information processing is inefficient in patients with Parkinson' disease (PD), 
      resulting in temporal judgment deficits. In general, the pathophysiology of PD 
      has been described as a dysfunction in the basal ganglia, which is a multisensory 
      integration station. Thus, a deficit in the sensorimotor integration process 
      could explain many of the Parkinson symptoms, such as changes in time perception. 
      This physiological distortion may be better understood if we analyze the 
      neurobiological model of interval timing, expressed within the conceptual 
      framework of a traditional information-processing model called "Scalar Expectancy 
      Theory". Therefore, in this review we discuss the pathophysiology and 
      sensorimotor integration process in PD, the theories and neural basic mechanisms 
      involved in temporal processing, and the main clinical findings about the impact 
      of time perception in PD.

TI  - A Focused Review of Gamma Neuromodulation as a Therapeutic Target in Alzheimer's 
      Spectrum Disorders.
LID - e240001 [pii]
LID - 10.20900/jpbs.20240001 [doi]
AB  - The aging population of the world is increasing at an unprecedented rate which is 
      expected to lead to a corresponding unparalleled increase in age related 
      diseases. Of particular concern are the large number of older adults expected to 
      develop Alzheimer's disease (AD), which will require extraordinary local, 
      national and worldwide healthcare resources. In this context, innovative 
      interventions are needed urgently to delay AD onset and thereby give our 
      healthcare systems time to prepare and provide meaningful care to our aging 
      populations. This focused review discusses the crucial role of frontal gamma 
      oscillations as a therapeutic target to delay or ameliorate cognitive decline in 
      AD. Frontal gamma oscillations, including from prefrontal cortical areas, serve 
      as a biomarker for working memory and other cognitive functions, and their 
      impairment is observed before clinical symptoms manifest. This review evaluates 
      evidence from animal models and human subjects to highlight the correlation 
      between gamma wave abnormalities and cognitive deterioration. Furthermore, the 
      review summarizes 11 clinical studies using neuromodulation techniques designed 
      to stimulate gamma oscillations in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD 
      patients, including transcranial electrical stimulation, transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation, and rhythmic sensory stimulation. These interventions have shown 
      promise in mitigating early-stage cognitive decline, as evidenced by improved 
      performance on memory tests, increased gamma oscillatory responses, and some have 
      even shown reduced brain atrophy. These early studies suggest that treatments 
      that strengthen frontal gamma oscillatory responses through neuromodulation are a 
      promising approach to delay cognitive decline, that may serve as an adjunct to 
      other therapies or as a standalone treatment in some populations.

TI  - Immediate placebo effect in Parkinson's disease--is the subjective relief 
      accompanied by objective improvement?
PG  - 222-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: A recent well-conducted meta-analysis showed that placebo effect is 
      associated with a possible small benefit for subjective outcomes, but has no 
      significant effects on objective outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we aimed to 
      investigate the immediate effects of two different types of placebo [placebo pill 
      and sham transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)] in Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      patients and compared them to the standard treatment (levodopa) in a proper 
      randomized, double-blind, crossover clinical trial. METHODS: PD patients received 
      three different interventions on different days: levodopa, placebo pill, and sham 
      TMS. The motor function was assessed using simple and choice reaction time, 
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), finger tapping, Purdue Pegboard 
      test, time to button up, walking time and supination-pronation. The subjective 
      motor function was measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: The 
      results showed that there was a significant motor function in the motor function 
      only after the treatment with levodopa, but not after treatment with placebo 
      pills or sham TMS. However, patients reported a similar subjective improvement in 
      motor function indexed by VAS following these three treatments. CONCLUSION: These 
      results suggest that placebo interventions in PD may have an immediate subjective 
      sensation of improvement but result in no significant objective motor changes 
      compared with levodopa treatment. Although physiological changes are possible 
      after a placebo intervention, our findings suggest that the acute placebo effect 
      in PD may be the result of the subjective change in the motor rating only.

      directions.
PG  - 98-109
LID - 10.1515/tnsci-2016-0016 [doi]
AB  - We all experience at least occasional lapses in attention but in some 
      neurological conditions, loss of attention is pervasive and debilitating. 
      Treating deficits in attention first requires an understanding of the 
      neurobiology of attention, which we now understand to be a set of different 
      cognitive processes. Cholinesterase inhibitors are already established as 
      effective attentional enhancers used in the treatment of certain dementias. Other 
      stimulant agents such as modafanil, amphetamine and methylphenidate have 
      demonstrated limited success in healthy individuals where attention is already 
      optimal and clinical trials in patients with neurological disease are sparse. 
      Dietary and lifestyle changes are gaining increasing prominence, as are 
      experimental treatments such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic 
      stimulation. As the therapeutic arsenal widens, clinicians will be able to match 
      specific treatments to selective deficits in attention, giving patients a 
      tailored management plan. Here we review common diseases that impair attention 
      and emphasise how an understanding of attentional processing within the brain 
      might lead to improved therapeutic strategies.

TI  - The Rehabilitation Potential of Neurostimulation for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury 
      in Animal and Human Studies.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci13101402 [doi]
LID - 1402
AB  - Neurostimulation carries high therapeutic potential, accompanied by an excellent 
      safety profile. In this review, we argue that an arena in which these tools could 
      provide breakthrough benefits is traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is a major 
      health problem worldwide, with the majority of cases identified as mild TBI 
      (mTBI). MTBI is of concern because it is a modifiable risk factor for dementia. A 
      major challenge in studying mTBI is its inherent heterogeneity across a large 
      feature space (e.g., etiology, age of injury, sex, treatment, initial health 
      status, etc.). Parallel lines of research in human and rodent mTBI can be 
      collated to take advantage of the full suite of neuroscience tools, from 
      neuroimaging (electroencephalography: EEG; functional magnetic resonance imaging: 
      fMRI; diffusion tensor imaging: DTI) to biochemical assays. Despite these 
      attractive components and the need for effective treatments, there are at least 
      two major challenges to implementation. First, there is insufficient 
      understanding of how neurostimulation alters neural mechanisms. Second, there is 
      insufficient understanding of how mTBI alters neural function. The goal of this 
      review is to assemble interrelated but disparate areas of research to identify 
      important gaps in knowledge impeding the implementation of neurostimulation.

TI  - [The cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease].
PG  - 1679-84
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive disorder which begins with motor 
      symptoms. Several cognitive deficits can be observed in nondemented patients with 
      PD during their history. The core symptom in the cognitive deficits in PD is the 
      executive dysfunction. Neuropsychological tests such as Wisconsin Card Sorting 
      Test, Trail Making Test are used to measure the degree of this dysfunction. 
      Executive dysfunction is thought related to abnormalities in the dorsolateral 
      prefrontal circuit which largely passes through the caudate nucleus. The 
      dysfunction emerges as the pathology spreads to the nigrocaudate project 
      corresponding to Hoehn & Yahr stage II-III. Effective therapy for cognitive 
      dysfunction in PD remains elusive, however donepezil, Attention Process Training, 
      Music therapy and Transcranial magnetic stimulation have been reported to have 
      partial efficacy.

AB  - The neural basis of semantic memory generates considerable debate. Semantic 
      dementia results from bilateral anterior temporal lobe (ATL) atrophy and gives 
      rise to a highly specific impairment of semantic memory, suggesting that this 
      region is a critical neural substrate for semantic processing. Recent rTMS 
      experiments with neurologically-intact participants also indicate that the ATL 
      are a necessary substrate for semantic memory. Exactly which regions within the 
      ATL are important for semantic memory are difficult to detect from these methods 
      (because the damage in SD covers a large part of the ATL). Functional 
      neuroimaging might provide important clues about which specific areas exhibit 
      activation that correlates with normal semantic performance. Neuroimaging 
      studies, however, have not consistently found anterior temporal lobe activation 
      in semantic tasks. A recent meta-analysis indicates that this inconsistency may 
      be due to a collection of technical limitations associated with previous studies, 
      including a reduced field-of-view and magnetic susceptibility artefacts 
      associated with standard gradient echo fMRI. We conducted an fMRI study of 
      semantic memory using a combination of techniques which improve sensitivity to 
      ATL activations whilst preserving whole-brain coverage. As expected from SD 
      patients and ATL rTMS experiments, this method revealed bilateral temporal 
      activation extending from the inferior temporal lobe along the fusiform gyrus to 
      the anterior temporal regions, bilaterally. We suggest that the inferior, 
      anterior temporal lobe region makes a crucial contribution to semantic cognition 
      and utilising this version of fMRI will enable further research on the semantic 
      role of the ATL.

PG  - 2162-4, 2166
AB  - Recent advances have allowed the development of new physical techniques in 
      neurology and psychiatry, such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Vagus 
      Nerve Stimulation (VNS), and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). These techniques are 
      already recognized as therapeutic approaches in several late stage refractory 
      neurological disorders (Parkinson's disease, tremor, epilepsy), and currently 
      investigated in psychiatric conditions, refractory to medical treatment 
      (obsessive-compulsive disorder, resistant major depression). In Paralell, these 
      new techniques offer a new window to understand the neurobiology of human 
      behavior.

TI  - The pharmacology of neuroplasticity induced by non-invasive brain stimulation: 
      building models for the clinical use of CNS active drugs.
PG  - 4641-62
LID - 10.1113/jphysiol.2012.232975 [doi]
AB  - The term neuroplasticity encompasses structural and functional modifications of 
      neuronal connectivity. Abnormal neuroplasticity is involved in various 
      neuropsychiatric diseases, such as dystonia, epilepsy, migraine, Alzheimer's 
      disease, fronto-temporal degeneration, schizophrenia, and post cerebral stroke. 
      Drugs affecting neuroplasticity are increasingly used as therapeutics in these 
      conditions. Neuroplasticity was first discovered and explored in animal 
      experimentation. However, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has enabled 
      researchers recently to induce and study similar processes in the intact human 
      brain. Plasticity induced by NIBS can be modulated by pharmacological 
      interventions, targeting ion channels, or neurotransmitters. Importantly, 
      abnormalities of plasticity as studied by NIBS are directly related to clinical 
      symptoms in neuropsychiatric diseases. Therefore, a core theme of this review is 
      the hypothesis that NIBS-induced plasticity can explore and potentially predict 
      the therapeutic efficacy of CNS-acting drugs in neuropsychiatric diseases. We 
      will (a) review the basics of neuroplasticity, as explored in animal 
      experimentation, and relate these to our knowledge about neuroplasticity induced 
      in humans by NIBS techniques. We will then (b) discuss pharmacological modulation 
      of plasticity in animals and humans. Finally, we will (c) review abnormalities of 
      plasticity in neuropsychiatric diseases, and discuss how the combination of NIBS 
      with pharmacological intervention may improve our understanding of the 
      pathophysiology of abnormal plasticity in these diseases and their purposeful 
      pharmacological treatment.

AB  - Modern interest in muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) activators for 
      schizophrenia began in the 1990s when xanomeline, an M(1)/M(4)-preferring mAChR 
      agonist developed for cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), had 
      unexpected antipsychotic activity. However, strategies to address tolerability 
      concerns associated with activation of peripheral mAChRs were not available at 
      that time. The discovery of specific targeted ligands and combination treatments 
      to reduce peripheral mAChR engagement have advanced the potential of mAChR 
      activators as effective treatments for psychotic disorders. This review provides 
      perspectives on the background of the identification of mAChRs as potential 
      antipsychotics, advances in the preclinical understanding of mAChRs as targets, 
      and the current state of mAChR activators under active clinical development for 
      schizophrenia.

      functions in several neurologic diseases treatment and sports performance. In 
      this study, we present a comprehensive, integrative review of tDCS for motor 
      rehabilitation and motor learning in healthy individuals, athletes and multiple 
      neurologic and neuropsychiatric conditions. We also report on neuromodulation 
      mechanisms, main applications, current knowledge including areas such as 
      language, embodied cognition, functional and social aspects, and future 
      directions. We present the use and perspectives of new developments in tDCS 
      technology, namely high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) which promises to overcome one 
      of the main tDCS limitation (i.e., low focality) and its application for 
      neurological disease, pain relief, and motor learning/rehabilitation. Finally, we 
      provided information regarding the Transcutaneous Spinal Direct Current 
      Stimulation (tsDCS) in clinical applications, Cerebellar tDCS (ctDCS) and 
      its influence on motor learning, and TMS combined with electroencephalography 
      (EEG) as a tool to evaluate tDCS effects on brain function.
