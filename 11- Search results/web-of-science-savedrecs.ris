TI  - Systematic review of the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions in people with Lewy body dementia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS
AB  - Background: Pharmacological interventions for Lewy body dementia (LBD), especially for its non-cognitive symptoms, are limited in their efficacy and tolerability. Clinicians are often uncertain about non-pharmacological interventions and their efficacy in managing cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms of LBD. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review the existing literature on non-pharmacological interventions for people with LBD.
   Methods: We carried out a systematic search using six databases. All human studies examining impact of any non-pharmacological intervention on LBD were assessed for cognitive, physical, psychiatric, and quality-of-life outcomes. Study quality was assessed by Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies and the CARE criteria checklist.
   Results: Prevailing evidence supporting the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions is weak. We screened 1,647 papers. Fifteen studies (n = 61) including 11 case reports were found eligible for this systematic review. Interventions and reported outcomes were heterogeneous. Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus basalis of Meynert reportedly conferred cognitive benefit. Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation have been reported to ameliorate depressive symptoms. Transcranial direct current stimulation was observed to improve attention. Exercise-based interventions reportedly improve various clinically important outcomes. Spaced retrieval memory training and environmental intervention for ''mirror sign'' have also been reported.
   Conclusions: Several non-pharmacological interventions have been studied in LBD. Although evidence supporting their efficacy is not robust, prevailing preliminary evidence and limitations of available pharmacological interventions indicate the need to consider appropriate non-pharmacological interventions, while planning comprehensive care of LBD patients. Larger trials evaluating the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for LBD are needed.

TI  - Non-Pharmacological Treatments in Lewy Body Disease: A Systematic Review
T2  - DEMENTIA AND GERIATRIC COGNITIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Introduction: Lewy body disease (LBD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in patients older than 65 years. LBD is characterized by heterogeneous symptoms like fluctuation in attention, visual hallucinations, Parkinsonism, and REM sleep behaviour disorders. Considering the relevant social impact of the disease, identifying effective non-pharmacological treatments is becoming a priority. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an up-to-date literature review of the most effective non-pharmacological treatments in patients with LBD, focussing on evidence-based interventions. Methods: Following PRISMA criteria, we carried out a systematic search through three databases (PubMed, Cochrane Libraries, and PEDro) including physical therapy (PT), cognitive rehabilitation (CR), light therapy (LT), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), deep brain stimulation (DBS). All studies were qualitatively assessed using standardized tools (CARE and EPHPP). Results: We obtained a total of 1,220 studies of which 23 original articles met eligibility criteria for inclusion. The total number of LBD patients included was 231; mean age was 69.98, predominantly men (68%). Some PT studies highlighted improvements in motor deficits. CR produced significant improvements in mood, cognition, and patient's quality of life and satisfaction. LT outlined a partial trend of improvements in mood and sleep quality. DBS, ECT, and TMS showed some partial improvements mainly on neuropsychiatric symptoms, whereas tDCS provided partial improvements in attention. Conclusion: This review highlights the efficacy of some evidence-based rehabilitation studies in LBD; however, further randomized controlled trials with larger samples are needed to provide definitive recommendations.

TI  - Treatment of psychiatric disturbances in hypokinetic movement disorders
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Introduction: We reviewed studies that assessed the treatment of psychiatric disturbances in Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonisms. Neuropsychiatric disturbances in these conditions are frequent and have a profound impact on quality of life of patients and of their caregivers. It is therefore important to be familiar with the appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for treating these disorders. Areas covered: The authors searched for papers in English in Pubmed using the following keywords: Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body dementia, depression, apathy, anxiety, fatigue, sleep disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, psychosis, hallucinations, delusions, impulse control disorders. Expert opinion: In Parkinson's disease, depression may benefit from the optimization of dopaminergic therapy, from the use of antidepressants acting on both the serotoninergic and noradrenergic pathways and from cognitive behavioral therapy. Psychosis in Parkinson's disease may improve with the use of clozapine; the serotonin inverse agonist pimavanserin has been shown to be effective. Treatment of impulse control disorders is primarily based on the removal of dopamine agonists. No controlled studies have investigated the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders in multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal degeneration. Acethylcholinesterase inhibitors may be used to treat hallucinations in Lewy body dementia.

TI  - Neurophysiological biomarkers for Lewy body dementias
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Lewy body dementias (LBD) include both dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), and the differentiation of LBD from other neurodegenerative dementias can be difficult. Currently, there are few biomarkers which might assist early diagnosis, map onto LBD symptom severity, and provide metrics of treatment response. Traditionally, biomarkers in LBD have focussed on neuroimaging modalities; however, as biomarkers need to be simple, inexpensive and non-invasive, neurophysiological approaches might also be useful as LBD biomarkers.
   Methods: In this review, we searched PubMED and PsycINFO databases in a semi-systematic manner in order to identify potential neurophysiological biomarkers in the LBDs.
   Results: We identified 1491 studies; of these, 37 studies specifically examined neurophysiological biomarkers in LBD patients. We found that there was substantial heterogeneity with respect to methodologies and patient cohorts.
   Conclusion: Generally, many of the findings have yet to be replicated, although preliminary findings reinforce the potential utility of approaches such as quantitative electroencephalography and motor cortical stimulation paradigms. Significance: Various neurophysiological techniques have the potential to be useful biomarkers in the LBDs. We recommend that future studies focus on maximising the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the most promising neurophysiological biomarkers.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - Dementia is a debilitating impairment of cognitive functions that affects millions of people worldwide. There are several diseases belonging to the dementia spectrum, most prominently Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), Lewy body dementia (LBD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, non-invasive form of brain stimulation that utilizes a magnetic coil to generate an electrical field and induce numerous changes in the brain. It is considered efficacious for the treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders. In this paper, we review the available studies involving rTMS in the treatment of these dementia types. The majority of studies have involved AD and shown beneficial effects, either as a standalone, or as an add-on to standard-of-care pharmacological treatment and cognitive training. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex seems to hold a central position in the applied protocols, but several parameters still need to be defined. In addition, rTMS has shown potential in mild cognitive impairment as well. Regarding the remaining dementias, research is still at preliminary phases, and large, randomized studies are currently lacking.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation neurophysiology in patients with non-Alzheimer's neurodegenerative diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Non-Alzheimer's dementia (NAD) accounts for 30% of all neurodegenerative conditions and is characterized by cognitive decline beyond mere memory dysfunction. Diagnosing NAD remains challenging due to the lack of established biomarkers. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neurophysiological tool that enables the investigation of cortical excitability in the human brain. Paired-pulse TMS paradigms include shortand long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI/LICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which can assess neurophysiological functions of GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic neural circuits, respectively. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to compare these TMS indices among patients with NAD and healthy controls. Our meta-analyses indicated that TMS neurophysiological examinations revealed decreased glutamatergic function in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and decreased GABAergic function in patients with FTD, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's disease, cortico-basal syndrome, and multiple system atrophy-parkinsonian type. In addition, decreased cholinergic function was found in dementia with Lewy body and vascular dementia. These results suggest the potential of TMS as an additional diagnostic tool to differentiate NAD.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation: Emerging biomarkers and novel therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most devastating conditions affecting elderly in Western World. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments, and patients diagnosed with AD face an uncertain future, caused by the current inability to predict the course of the disease. This is mainly due to the poor comprehension of AD pathophysiology and of patients' clinical heterogeneity. In recent years, several evidences supported the concept that loss of synaptic density could be an early event and precede neuronal degeneration, suggesting that the impairment of synaptic transmission should play a key role in the pathogenesis of different forms of dementia, including AD, frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia. Despite this emerging background it has not been possible to quantify synaptic functioning (or dysfunction) directly in vivo in AD patients. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been recently introduced as a novel approach able to identify the early signatures of synaptic dysfunction characterizing the different forms of AD. We review the novel emerging neurophysiological signatures of AD and how this information may be used as biomarkers for differential diagnosis, disease progression and response to therapy. Finally, we also consider novel therapeutic approaches based on the clinical use of repetitive TMS.

TI  - Depression in dementia with Lewy bodies: a critical update
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION
AB  - Depression with an estimated prevalence of 35% is a frequent manifestation of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), having negative effects on cognitive performance and life expectancy, yet the underlying neurobiology is poorly understood and most likely heterogeneous. Depressive symptoms in DLB can occur during the clinical course and, together with apathy, is a common prodromal neuropsychiatric symptom of this neurocognitive disorder in the group of Lewy body synucleinopathies. There are no essential differences in the frequency of depression in DLB and Parkinson disease-dementia (PDD), while its severity is up to twice as high as in Alzheimer disease (AD). Depression in DLB that is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated, has been related to a variety of pathogenic mechanisms associated with the basic neurodegenerative process, in particular dysfunctions of neurotransmitter systems (decreased monoaminergic/serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic metabolism), & alpha;-synuclein pathology, synaptic zinc dysregulation, proteasome inhibition, gray matter volume loss in prefrontal and temporal areas as well as dysfunction of neuronal circuits with decreased functional connectivity of specific brain networks. Pharmacotherapy should avoid tricyclic antidepressants (anticholinergic adverse effects), second-generation antidepressants being a better choice, while modified electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy and deep brain stimulation may be effective for pharmacotherapy-resistant cases. Since compared to depression in other dementias like Alzheimer disease and other parkinsonian syndromes, our knowledge of its molecular basis is limited, and further studies to elucidate the heterogeneous pathogenesis of depression in DLB are warranted.

TI  - Measuring network disruption in neurodegenerative diseases: New approaches using signal analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Advanced neuroimaging has increased understanding of the pathogenesis and spread of disease, and offered new therapeutic targets. MRI and positron emission tomography have shown that neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are associated with changes in brain networks. However, the underlying neurophysiological pathways driving pathological processes are poorly defined. The gap between what imaging can discern and underlying pathophysiology can now be addressed by advanced techniques that explore the cortical neural synchronisation, excitability and functional connectivity that underpin cognitive, motor, sensory and other functions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation can show changes in focal excitability in cortical and transcortical motor circuits, while electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography can now record cortical neural synchronisation and connectivity with good temporal and spatial resolution. Here we reflect on the most promising new approaches to measuring network disruption in AD, LBD, PD, FTD, MS, and ALS. We consider the most groundbreaking and clinically promising studies in this field. We outline the limitations of these techniques and how they can be tackled and discuss how these novel approaches can assist in clinical trials by predicting and monitoring progression of neurophysiological changes underpinning clinical symptomatology.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of depression in Parkinson disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of depression in patients with Parkinson disease in order to arrive at qualitative and quantitative conclusions about the efficacy of rTMS. We included randomized controlled trials examining the effects of rTMS compared with sham-rTMS or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The quality of included studies was strictly evaluated. Data analyses were performed using the RevMan5.1 software. Eight studies including 312 patients met all inclusion criteria. The results showed that rTMS could evidently improve the HRSD score compared with sham-rTMS (p < 0.00001). However, we found similar antidepressant efficacy between rTMS and SSRIs groups in terms of HRSD and BDI score (p = 0.65; p = 0.75, respectively). Furthermore, patients who received rTMS could evidently show improvement on the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS), ADL score, and UPDRS motor score compared with sham-rTMS or SSRIs (p < 0.05, p = 0.05, respectively). The subgroup analysis by frequency of rTMS evidenced that the efficacy of low-frequency rTMS was superior to sham-rTMS (p < 0.0001) in terms of the outcome measure according to HAMD scale. Meanwhile, the high-frequency rTMS has the same antidepressant efficacy as SSRIs (p = 0.94). The current meta-analysis provided evidence that rTMS was superior to sham-rTMS and had similar antidepressant efficacy as SSRIs, and may have the additional advantage of some improvement in motor function.

TI  - Efficacy of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) Combined with Psychological Interventions: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - (1) Background: Psychological interventions are effective in alleviating neuropsychiatric symptoms, though results can vary between patients. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proven to improve clinical symptoms and cognition. It remains unclear whether rTMS can augment the efficacy of psychological interventions. (2) Methods: We examined the effects of rTMS combined with psychological interventions on clinical, functional, and cognitive outcomes from randomized controlled trials conducted in healthy and clinical populations. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO databases up to April 2023. (3) Results: Twenty-seven studies were ultimately included. Compared to sham rTMS combined with psychological interventions, active rTMS combined with psychological interventions significantly improved overall clinical symptoms (k = 16, SMD = 0.31, CIs 0.08 to 0.54, p < 0.01). We found that 10 or more sessions of rTMS combined with cognitive behavioural therapy significantly improved clinical outcomes overall (k = 3, SMD = 0.21, CIs 0.05 to 0.36, Z = 2.49, p < 0.01). RTMS combined with cognitive training (CT) significantly improved cognition overall compared to sham rTMS combined with CT (k = 13, SMD = 0.28, CIs 0.15 to 0.42, p < 0.01), with a significant effect on global cognition (k = 11, SMD = 0.45, CIs 0.21 to 0.68, p < 0.01), but not on the other cognitive domains. (4) Conclusion: The current results provide preliminary support for the augmentation effects of active rTMS on clinical and cognitive outcomes across diverse populations. Future clinical trials are required to confirm these augmentation effects for specific psychological interventions in specific clinical populations.

TI  - Motor recovery and antidepressant effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on Parkinson disease A PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Clinical symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) included both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Previous studies indicated inconsistent results for the therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on motor and depression in PD. The study aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of rTMS with different mode on motor and depression in PD using a meta-analysis. Methods: Articles published before July 2019 were searched based on the following databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar). The therapeutic effects were assessed by computing the standard mean difference (SMD) and a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: The present study indicated that rTMS showed significant therapeutic effects on motor in PD (SMD 2.05, 95% CI 1.57-2.53,I-2 = 93.0%,P < .001). Both high-frequency (HF)-rTMS and low-frequency rTMS showed therapeutic effects on motor; stimulation over primary motor cortex (M1), supplementary motor area, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or M1+DLPFC showed therapeutic effects; stimulation during "on" and "off" states showed therapeutic effects; the study showed long-term effect of rTMS on motor in PD. In addition, the study indicated that rTMS showed significant therapeutic effects on depression in PD (SMD 0.80, 95% CI 0.31-1.29,I-2 = 89.1%,P < .001). Stimulation over left DLPFC showed significant therapeutic effects on depression in PD; only HF-rTMS showed therapeutic effects; ages, disease durations, numbers of pulses, and session durations displayed influence on the therapeutic effects of rTMS on depression in PD; the therapeutic effects on depression was long term. However, no significant difference in therapeutic effects on depression were showed between rTMS and oral Fluoxetine (SMD 0.74, 95% CI -0.83 to 2.31,I-2 = 92.5%,P < .001). Conclusion: The rTMS showed significant therapeutic effects on motor in PD. HF-rTMS showed a significant positive antidepressive effect in PD only over DLPFC.

TI  - The efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for Parkinson disease patients with depression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for Parkinson disease (PD) patients with depression. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed using relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from online databases such as PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Online Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Studies were selected according to pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the quality of the studies was evaluated using the Jadad Scale. All data were pooled by RevMan 5.2 software for meta-analysis. Results: The review covered 528 articles, and 7 articles with Jadad score ?4 were included in the analysis. The meta-analysis showed that, compared to sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (sham-rTMS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) improved depression, but that there was no significant difference in depression improvement between rTMS and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment. In contrast, rTMS over DLPFC did not improve motor function compared to sham-rTMS or SSRI, and the studies that included neurocognitive measures showed no significant difference between rTMS and sham-rTMS. Conclusion: This meta-analysis provides evidence that rTMS over DLPFC can improve depression similar to SSRI treatment, has no effect on the motor function and cognition of PD patients with depression.

TI  - Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with cognitive training on cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) paired with cognitive training on cognitive function in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. Methods: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL Complete (EBSCO), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang Database were searched. The risk of bias was appraised through the Cochrane collaboration tool. A meta-analysis was conducted, including an assessment of heterogeneity. Results: Ten studies comprising 408 participants were included. The addition of rTMS significantly improved overall cognition in patients compared with cognitive intervention alone (p < 0.05 for all tests). The treatment also had some continuity, with significant improvements in cognitive function within weeks after the treatment ended (p < 0.05 for all tests). Conclusion: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with cognitive training (rTMS-CT) is a valuable technique for the cognitive rehabilitation of AD patients. It is beneficial to improve the cognitive ability of patients and restore their overall functional state. The results of the study may provide a basis for clinical providers to implement interventions that facilitate the design of more rigorous and high-quality interventions. Limitations: The number of studies and sample size in our study were small. We did not explore possible interactions between rTMS and medications and mood improvement after rTMS due to inadequate data. Systematic review registration: This study was registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42023405615.

   MethodsA literature search was performed for articles published in English using the 10 databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, INSPEC, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, AMED, Biological Sciences, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) from their inception to May 2016. The primary outcome was cognitive function as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale.
   ResultsSeven RCTs were included in the meta-analysis, with a sample of 107 active and 87 sham rTMS. Active rTMS was found to be more effective in improving cognition (Hedges' g=0.48; 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.84).
   ConclusionsHigh-frequency rTMS showed a benefit on cognition amongst older patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. rTMS was shown to have great potential as a safe and well-tolerated alternative intervention for cognition. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Effect of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Gait and Freezing of Gait in Parkinson Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this review was to systematically assess the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) intervention on gait in individuals with Parkinson disease (PD).
   Data Sources: We searched online electronic databases up to March 28, 2019, including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and so on.
   Study Selection: The inclusion criteria for this review were randomized controlled trials (RCT5), exploring the effect of rTMS in patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD.
   Data Extraction: Data extraction was performed independently by 2 reviewers based on predefined criteria and the methodologic quality of included studies was quantified by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. The outcome measure was walking performance, including walking time (short term and long term), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and so on.
   Data Synthesis: Among 14 eligible studies, including 298 participants (mean age +/- SD [y], 63.24 +/- 9.71; 191 [64%] men) were analyzed in this meta-analysis. Walking time was improved with rTMS compared with sham rTMS (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.57 to -0.03; P=.03). The score for the freezing of gait questionnaire did not differ significantly between rTMS and no intervention. Four studies compared TUG between the 2 treatment groups and no significant differences were found between the rTMS and control group (SMD -0.45; 95% CI, -1.32 to 0.41; P=.30). During the off-state, there were no significant differences in estimated effect sizes (SMD = -0.29; 95% CI, -0.79 to 0.21; P=.25), which is significantly different in on-state (SMD -0.98; 95% CI, -1.78 to -0.18; P=.02) evaluation.
   Conclusions: The results of the meta-analysis propose the favorable effect of rTMS on walking performance in the short term but not over the long term in individuals with PD. (C) 2019 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Poststroke Memory Disorder: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Patients with post-stroke memory disorder (PSMD) have poor quality of life and it is necessary to identify more beneficial stimulation protocols for treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of rTMS for improving memory performance, global cognition, and activities of daily living (ADL) among patients with PSMD. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology Journal Database, and Wanfang databases were screened to identify relevant randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome was memory performance; secondary outcomes included global cognition, ADL, and adverse events. STATA software was used to perform data synthesis. Results: Five articles with a total of 192 participants were included. The results indicated that rTMS was superior to control treatments for improving memory performance (mean difference [MD] = 1.73, 95% CI [Confidence Interval] [0.85, 2.60], p < 0.001), global cognition (MD = 2.44, 95% CI [0.96, 3.93], p < 0.001), and ADL (MD = 10.29, 95% CI [5.10, 15.48], p < 0.001). No significant differences were found between the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) rTMS subgroups (p = 0.47, I-2 = 0.00%) or between the sham rTMS and non-rTMS subgroups (p = 0.94, I-2 = 0.00%). Four studies did not reported adverse events. Conclusions: rTMS may improve memory function, global cognition, and the ability to perform ADL in patients with PSMD. LF-rTMS and HF-rTMS may have equal efficacy for treatment of PSMD. Future studies should consider extending the follow-up period to explore the safety and long-term efficacy of rTMS for treatment of PSMD and the appropriate choice of placebo for clinical trials of this treatment.

TI  - Efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
AB  - Background Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive form of brain stimulation that positively regulates the motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although, most reviews and meta-analysis have shown that rTMS intervention is effective in treating motor symptoms and depression, very few have used randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to analyse the efficacy of this intervention in PD. We aimed to review RCTs of rTMS in patients with PD to assess the efficacy of rTMS on motor and non-motor function in patients with PD.
   Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, MEDLINE and Web of Science data-bases for RCTs on rTMS in PD published between January 1, 1988 to January 1, 2022. Eligible studies included sham-controlled RCTs that used rTMS stimulation for motor or non-motor symptoms in PD. RCTs not focusing on the efficacy of rTMS in PD were excluded. Summary data were extracting from those RCTs by two investigators independently. We then calculated standardised mean difference with random-effect models. The main outcome included motor and non-motor examination of scales that were used in PD motor or non-motor assessment. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022329633.
   Findings Fourteen studies with 469 patients met the criteria for our meta-analysis. Twelve eligible studies with 381 patients were pooled to analyse the efficacy of rTMS on motor function improvement. The effect size on motor scale scores was 0.51 (P < 0.0001) and were not distinctly heterogeneous (I-2 = 29%). Five eligible studies with 202 patients were collected to evaluate antidepressant-like effects. The effect size on depression scale scores was 0.42 (P = 0.004), and were not distinctly heterogeneous (I-2 = 25%), indicating a significant anti-depressive effect (P = 0.004). The results suggest that high-frequency of rTMS on primary motor cortex (M1) is effective in improving motor symptoms; while the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) may be a potentially effective area in alleviating depressive symptom.
   Interpretation The findings suggest that rTMS could be used as a possible adjuvant therapy for PD mainly to improve motor symptoms, but could have potential efficacy on depressive symptoms of PD. However, further investigation is needed. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Improving Cognitive Function in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of Alzheimer's disease. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been widely employed in MCI research. However, there is no reliable systematic evidence regarding the effects of rTMS on MCI. The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rTMS in the treatment of MCI.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search of nine electronic databases was performed to identify articles published in English or Chinese before June 20, 2019. The identified articles were screened, data were extracted, and the methodological quality of the included trials was assessed. The meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5.3 software. We used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence.
   Results: Nine studies comprising 369 patients were included. The meta-analysis showed that rTMS may significantly improve global cognitive function (standardized mean difference [SMD] 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 3.24, p = 0.0004, seven studies, n = 296; low-quality evidence) and memory (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.72, p = 0.002, six studies, n = 204; moderate-quality evidence). However, there was no significant improvement in executive function and attention (p > 0.05). Subgroup analyses revealed the following: (1) rTMS targeting the left hemisphere significantly enhanced global cognitive function, while rTMS targeting the bilateral hemispheres significantly enhanced global cognitive function and memory; (2) high-frequency rTMS significantly enhanced global cognitive function and memory; and (3) a high number of treatments >= 20 times could improve global cognitive function and memory. There was no significant difference in dropout rate (p > 0.05) between the rTMS and control groups. However, patients who received rTMS had a higher rate of mild adverse effects (risk ratio 2.03, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.52, p = 0.01, seven studies, n = 317; moderate-quality evidence).
   Conclusions: rTMS appears to improve global cognitive function and memory in patients with MCI and may have good acceptability and mild adverse effects. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the relatively small number of trials, particularly for low-frequency rTMS.

TI  - An overview of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in Alzheimer's disease
T2  - SALUD MENTAL
AB  - Background. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent neurocognitive disorder. It affects 50% to 75% of the cases of dementia, and is characterized by a progressive cognitive decline that hinders behavior and functionality. Its etiology is still uncertain, and the efficiency of treatments is limited. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used as an alternative therapeutic strategy, but the clinical impact on Alzheimer's disease has hardly been studied. Objective. To describe the effects of rTMS on cognition, the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and functionality, considering the various modes of application. Method. The PubMed, ScienceDirect, and PsycInfo databases were consulted using key words relating to the topic of study. Articles published between 2006 and 2016 were selected. Results. The studies that have assessed the clinical effect of rTMS have used various parameters to stimulate and compare the different cortical areas, principally the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. A variety of benefits have been proposed for patients with Alzheimer's disease in cognitive domains such as language and episodic memory, as well as behavior and functionality in everyday activities. Discussion and conclusion. rTMS has been suggested as a possible treatment for AD, and the results indicate the need for further studies with different methodological designs and more participants, in addition to cognitive rehabilitation techniques. The objective is to identify the most efficient parameters for stimulation and to explore new cortical targets.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for multiple neurological conditions in rodent animal models: A systematic review
T2  - NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique. Recently, rTMS has shown promising therapeutic potential in multiple neurological conditions. Nevertheless, challenges remain in the clinical application of rTMS, which mainly due to the lack of consensus on optimal stimulation protocols and poor understanding of the exact targets driving its action. Experimental animal research with more controllable factors may contribute to fill our knowledge gap in this area, and to accelerate the development of clinical translation studies. Therefore, the current study was designed to systematically review the effects of rTMS on animal models of certain diseases and evaluate its potential mechanisms of action, which may guide future studies aiming to improve the therapeutic utilization for these diseases.Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted through the PubMed online database on August 19, 2021. The search strategy consisted of two main components: rTMS and stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), with results limited to animal studies.Results: We identified 41 animal studies, 21 that examined stroke, 8 that investigated Alzheimer's disease, 5 that studied vascular dementia, and 7 that examined Parkinson's disease, all of these studies were conducted in rodents (rat and mice). Despite variations in study design and research methods, the therapeutic benefits of rTMS, as reflected in the alleviation of disease-related symptoms and pathological improvements, have been reported in these studies. rTMS induces multi-directional changes at the cellular and molecular levels, including a significant contribution to synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, the curative effects of rTMS are related to stimulation parameters, with high-frequency rTMS reported has better therapeutic efficacy in several studies. In terms of safety, one study involving combination therapy reported the adverse effects of rTMS administration.Conclusions: rTMS have shown encouraging therapeutic value in rodent models of stroke, AD, VaD, and PD. Nonetheless, the optimal protocols and exact target of action for this therapy remain to be determined. Correspondingly, further research is still needed to bridge the translation gap between rodent experiments and clinical application, which might lead to new directions in the treatment of multiple neurological disorders.

TI  - High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) impacts activities of daily living of patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - ObjectiveTo systematically evaluate the impact of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) on activities of daily living (ADLs) of patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI).Data sourcesRelevant studies published as of November 2022 (English and Chinese) were searched in Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, OVID, China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), Wanfang, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and SinoMed databases.Review methodsRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) that used HF-rTMS for the treatment of ADLs in patients with PSCI were included in this meta-analysis. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted the data, evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and cross-checked.ResultsForty-one RCTs involving 2855 patients with PSCI were included. In 30 RCTs, the experimental group received HF-rTMS in addition to the interventions used in the control group. In 11 RCTs, the experimental group received HF-rTMS while the control group received sham-rTMS. Barthel Index (BI), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) were higher in the HF-rTMS group than in the control group, whereas scores of Blessed Behavior Scale was lower in the HF-rTMS group than in the control group. All P < 0.05. In 36 studies, the stimulation sites were on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).ConclusionHF-rTMS can ameliorate ADLs of patients with PSCI and has a better rehabilitation effect on PSCI.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Effects on Cognitive Functions-A Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique also used as a non-pharmacological intervention against cognitive impairment. The purpose of the present review was to summarize what is currently known about the effectiveness of rTMS intervention on different cognitive domains in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to address potential neuromodulation approaches in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) and neuroimaging, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this systematic review, we consulted three main databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus), and Google Scholar was selected for the gray literature search. The PRISMA flowchart drove the studies' inclusion. The selection process ensured that only high-quality studies were included; after removing duplicate papers, explicit ratings were given based on the quality classification as high (A), moderate (B), or low (C), considering factors such as risks of bias, inaccuracies, inconsistencies, lack of direction, and publication bias. Seven full-text articles fulfilled the stated inclusion, reporting five double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled studies, a case study, and a randomized crossover trial. The results of the reviewed studies suggested that rTMS in MCI patients is safe and effective for enhancing cognitive functions, thus making it a potential therapeutic approach for MCI patients. Changes in functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) after targeted rTMS could represent a valuable indicator of treatment response. Finally, high-frequency rTMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been shown to significantly enhance cognitive functions, such as executive performance, together with the increase of functional connectivity within frontoparietal networks. The main limitations were the number of included studies and the exclusion of studies using intermittent theta-burst stimulation, used in studies on Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, neuroimaging techniques in combination with rTMS have been shown to be useful for future network-based, fMRI-guided therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) Therapy in Parkinson Disease: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - PM&R
AB  - Objective: Several studies have reported repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy as an effective treatment for the control of motor symptoms in Parkinson disease. The objective of the study is to quantify the overall efficacy of this treatment.
   Types: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Literature survey: We reviewed the literature on clinical rTMS trials in Parkinson disease since the technique was introduced in 1980. We used the following databases: MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane, and CINAHL.
   Methodology: Patients and setting: Patients with Parkinson disease who were participating in prospective clinical trials that included an active arm and a control arm and change in motor scores on Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale as the primary outcome. We pooled data from 21 studies that met these criteria. We then analyzed separately the effects of low-and high-frequency rTMS on clinical motor improvements.
   Synthesis: The overall pooled mean difference between treatment and control groups in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score was significant (4.0 points, 95% confidence interval, 1.5, 6.7; P = .005). rTMS therapy was effective when low-frequency stimulation(<= 1 Hz) was used with a pooled mean difference of 3.3 points (95% confidence interval 1.6, 5.0; P = .005). There was a trend for significance when high-frequency stimulation (>= 5 Hz) studies were evaluated with a pooled mean difference of 3.9 points (95% confidence interval, -0.7, 8.5; P = .08). rTMS therapy demonstrated benefits at short-term follow-up (immediately after a treatment protocol) with a pooled mean difference of 3.4 points (95% confidence interval, 0.3, 6.6; P = .03) as well as at long-term follow-up (average follow-up 6 weeks) with mean difference of 4.1 points (95% confidence interval, -0.15, 8.4; P = .05). There were insufficient data to statistically analyze the effects of rTMS when we specifically examined bradykinesia, gait, and levodopa-induced dyskinesia using quantitative methods.
   Conclusion: rTMS therapy in patients with Parkinson disease results in mild-to-moderate motor improvements and has the potential to be used as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of Parkinson disease. Future large, sample studies should be designed to isolate the specific clinical features of Parkinson disease that respond well to rTMS therapy.

TI  - The Neuroprotection of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Pre-treatment in Vascular Dementia Rats
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive technique that could interfere cortical excitability though brief electric currents induced by alternating magnetic fields from the inductive coil. Currently, it has been applied in many fields of basic and clinical neuro-research. The aims of the present study are to investigate the effect of rTMS pre-treatment on cognitive function in vascular dementia (VaD) rats and further explore the molecular mechanism of rTMS neuroprotection on VaD. We found that rTMS pre-treated VaD rats showed significantly better memory and learning abilities in Morris water maze test compared to the untreated group. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expression levels of BDNF, TrkB, and SYN were significantly higher in the rTMS pre-treated group, indicating that rTMS pre-treatment has neuroprotective effect for VaD, which may have resulted from the increased level of BDNF, TrkB, and SYN in the hippocampal CA1 area.

TI  - Cognitive Enhancement of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Early Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, has been considered as a potentially effective treatment for the cognitive impairment in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the effectiveness of this therapy is still under debate due to the variety of rTMS parameters and individual differences including distinctive stages of AD in the previous studies. The current meta-analysis is aiming to assess the cognitive enhancement of rTMS treatment on patients of MCI and early AD. Three datasets (PubMed, Web of Science and CKNI) were searched with relative terms and finally twelve studies with 438 participants (231 in the rTMS group and 207 in the control group) in thirteen randomized, double-blind and controlled trials were included. Random effects analysis revealed that rTMS stimulation significantly introduced cognitive benefits in patients of MCI and early AD compared with the control group (mean effect size, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.76 - 1.57). Most settings of rTMS parameters (frequency, session number, stimulation site number) significantly enhanced global cognitive function, and the results revealed that protocols with 10 Hz repetition frequency and DLPFC as the stimulation site for 20 sessions can already be able to produce cognitive improvement. The cognitive enhancement of rTMS could last for one month after the end of treatment and patients with MCI were likely to benefit more from the rTMS stimulation. Our meta-analysis added important evidence to the cognitive enhancement of rTMS in patients with MCI and early AD and discussed potential underlying mechanisms about the effect induced by rTMS.

TI  - High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) on global cognitive function of elderly in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Objective High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique used to improve cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of HF-rTMS in improving global cognitive function rehabilitation in elderly patients with mild to moderate AD.
   Methods A detailed literature search of publications using ten databases (Chinese: Wanfang, VIP Periodical, SinoMed, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure; English: PubMed, Embase, OVID, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and EBSCOhost) was performed to identify English and Chinese language articles published up to December 2022. We only included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate the effect of HF-rTMS on elderly patients with mild to moderate AD. The retrieved studies were carefully reviewed, extracted data, and assessed quality.
   Results Seventeen studies, including 1161 elderly patients with mild to moderate AD, were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to the control group, HF-rTMS could increase MMSE (mean difference [MD] = 3.64; 95%CI 1.86-5.42; P < 0.0001), MoCA (MD = 3.69; 95%CI 1.84-5.54; P < 0.0001), P300 amplitude (MD = 1.09; 95%CI 0.45-1.72; P = 0.0008), and total effective rate scores (MD = 3.64; 95% CI 2.14-6.18; P < 0.00001) while decreasing ADAS-Cog (MD = -3.53; 95%CI -4.91- -2.15; P < 0.00001) and P300 latency scores (MD = -38.32; 95%CI - 72.40- -4.24; P = 0.03). Our study showed that HF-rTMS could improve the global cognitive function of elderly patients with mild to moderate AD.
   Conclusion HF-rTMS can improve global cognitive function in elderly patients with mild to moderate AD, which is an effective and safe rehabilitation treatment tool for AD patients.

TI  - Role of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in management of alzheimer's disease
T2  - ANNALS OF INDIAN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Management strategies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are challenging and limited in several aspects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), being a noninvasive brain stimulation method, has recently been studied in the management of AD. The literature available is different on several aspects such as patient enrollment, site of stimulation, outcome measures, and follow-up. We present a narrative review highlighting important aspects of rTMS in AD. We searched the databases of Google Scholar and PubMed using the search terms: rTMS and Alzheimer's disease; rTMS and cognition; rTMS and dementia; and brain stimulation and Alzheimer's disease. Original research, case reports and series, other narrative reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were included, and studies where only abstracts were available were excluded. Majority of the studies present a modest benefit of rTMS in mild-moderate AD and some in normal aging and mild cognitive impairment. Improvement is marked in high-frequency rTMS as compared to low frequency. The favorite site of stimulation appears to be the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Studies chiefly assessed cognitive function, while sparingly involving other areas of impairment such as psychopathology and global functioning. Improvement in cognition is mainly in the weeks ensuring rTMS, and studies assessing improvement in a long-term follow-up are needed. There appears to be minimal to no side effects reported in most studies. Future implications of rTMS in AD are suggested.

TI  - Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation over Prefrontal Cortex on Attention in Psychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be effective for enhancing cognitive functioning. In this review, we aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of rTMS on attention in psychiatric diseases. In particular, we searched PubMed and Embase to examine the effectiveness of rTMS administered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on this specific cognitive domain. The search identified 24 articles, 21 of which met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among them, nine were conducted in patients with depression, four in patients with schizophrenia, three in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), two in patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, one each in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in patients with alcohol or methamphetamine addiction. No evidence for cognitive adverse effects was found in all the included rTMS studies. Several studies showed a significant improvement of attentional function in patients with depression and schizophrenia. The beneficial effects on attention and other executive functions suggest that rTMS has the potential to target core features of ASD. rTMS may influence the attentional networks in alcohol-dependent and other addicted patients. We also reviewed and discussed the studies assessing the effects of rTMS on attention in the healthy population. This review suggests that prefrontal rTMS could exert procognitive effects on attention in patients with many psychiatric disorders.

TI  - The role of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Background: Although repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been considered a potentially effective treatment for cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), previous studies have produced inconsistent results. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of rTMS on cognitive function in patients with AD.
   Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for relevant terms. Abstracts of all papers were carefully reviewed, followed by data extraction, quality assessment, data synthesis and subgroup analyses. Result A total of 12 studies with 231 patients were included, with 8 randomized controlled studies and 4 selfcontrolled studies. Eleven studies used high frequency rTMS ( 5 Hz), but only one study directly compared the difference between low-frequency (1 Hz) and high-frequency (20 Hz). Random-effects analysis revealed that rTMS could significantly improve cognition compared with sham-rTMS (SMD: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.35-0.85, P <.0001). In subgroup analyses, the effect for stimulation at a single target was 0.13 (95% CI: 0.35-0.62) and multiple targets 0.86 (95% CI: 0.18-1.54). Treatment for 5 3 sessions produced an effect of 0.29 (95% CI: 1.04-1.62), whereas treatment for 5 sessions produced an effect of 2.77 (95% CI: 2.22-3.32). No differences were found for rTMS combined with medication or cognitive training.
   Conclusions: rTMS can significantly improve cognitive ability in patients with mild to moderate AD. Stimulation of multiple sites and long-term treatment are better at improving AD-associated cognitive performance. Furthermore, some novel interventional targets, like precuneus (PC), may be a more effective therapeutic site to improve memory in AD.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique for Alzheimer's disease (AD). rTMS, with high- or low-frequency, is thought to enhance or inhibit the cortical activities, respectively. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to summarize the efficacy of the rTMS on the cognition of AD patients and to identify its potential influential factors. Methods Literature from the Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched and screened to identify eligible studies. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval were used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of rTMS. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the influential factors. Results Ten studies with 15 trials involving 240 patients were included. Compared with sham stimulation, rTMS could significantly improve cognition in AD (SMD, 0.42; 95% CI 0.18-0.67; P = 0.0006). Subgroup analysis suggested significant cognitive enhancement in participants receiving rTMS on multiple sites rather than on single site, and in patients receiving rTMS of more than 10 sessions, but not <= 10 sessions. Compared with rTMS as the single therapeutic method, rTMS with concurrent cognitive training seemed to produce greater improvement. Moreover, 20 Hz rTMS, seemed to be more effective than 10 Hz or 1 Hz rTMS. Furthermore, patients with higher education, or with mild-to-moderate AD were more likely to benefit from rTMS than patients with lower education, or with severe dementia, respectively. Conclusions Based on the current evidence, rTMS was an effective therapy for cognitive impairment in AD. Large RCTs are warranted to further validate the results of our subgroup analyses.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation as an Alternative Therapy for Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Background: Recent studies have indicated that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could improve cognitive function in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet the results are inconclusive.
   Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate recent rTMS studies conducted in mild to moderate AD patients.
   Methods: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE databases and Science Direct were searched for studies of rTMS treatment on AD patients with cognitive impairment published before February 2015. The relevant primary outcomes of cognition were extracted from those included studies. A crude standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by using random effect models.
   Results: Seven studies with a total of 94 mild to moderate AD patients were included in this meta-analysis. A significant overall rTMS treatment effect on cognition was found for all AD patients (p = 0.0008, SMD= 1.00, 95% CI = 0.41-1.58). Stratification analysis showed that this effect is stimulation frequency-and hemisphere-dependent. High frequency stimulation (>1.0 Hz) (p < 0.05) but not low frequency stimulation (<= 1.0 Hz) (p > 0.05) was significantly effective in improving the cognition of AD patients. Further, rTMS stimulation on right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral DLPFC (p < 0.05), but not on the left DLPFC (p > 0.05) was significantly effective in improving cognitive function of AD patients. A significant effect was observed in the rTMS subgroup (p < 0.05), rather than in the rTMS+drug subgroup (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis supports that high frequency rTMS stimulation on right-or bilateral-DLPFC has significant therapeutic effect on cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate AD. Due to small number of studies included, more well-controlled rTMS studies should be evaluated in AD patients in the future.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for apathy in patients with neurodegenerative conditions, cognitive impairment, stroke, and traumatic brain injury: a systematic review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: We aimed to determine the effects and tolerability of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on apathy in patients with neurodegenerative conditions, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) via systematic review.Methods: We conducted a systematic search in major electronic health databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO, covering the period from inception to June 2023. Comparative clinical trials and cohort studies, and studies with before-after designs were considered for inclusion. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tools to assess methodological quality.Results: Out of 258 records identified, 14 studies met our eligibility criteria (11 randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 3 studies utilized before-and-after designs) with a total of 418 patients (overall female-to-male ratio 1:1.17) included in the review. The overall methodological quality of the included studies was assessed to be fair to good. The stimulation parameters used varied considerably across the studies. The summary findings of our review indicate the following observations on the effects of rTMS on apathy: (1) the results of all included studies in Alzheimer's disease investigating the effects of rTMS on apathy have consistently shown a positive impact on apathy; (2) the majority of studies conducted in Parkinson's disease have not found statistically significant results; (3) a single study (RCT) on patients with primary progressive aphasia demonstrated significant beneficial effects of rTMS on apathy; (4) the trials conducted on individuals with MCI yielded varying conclusions; (5) one study (RCT) in chronic stroke suggested that rTMS might have the potential to improve apathy; (6) one study conducted on individuals with mild TBI did not find a significant favorable association on apathy; and (7) the use of different rTMS protocols on the populations described is generally safe.Conclusion: The feasibility of utilizing rTMS as a treatment for apathy has been suggested in this review. Overall, limited evidence suggests that rTMS intervention may have the potential to modify apathy among patients with AD, PPA, MCI and chronic stroke, but less so in PD and mild TBI. These findings require confirmation by larger, well-designed clinical trials.

TI  - Improvements in Symptoms Following Neuronavigated Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) in Severe and Enduring Anorexia Nervosa: Findings from two Case Studies
T2  - EUROPEAN EATING DISORDERS REVIEW
AB  - BackgroundAdvances in the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) are most likely to arise from targeted, brain-directed treatments, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). We describe findings from two individuals with treatment-resistant AN who received 19-20 sessions of neuronavigated, high frequency rTMS, applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
   MethodWithin-session measures assessed changes pre-rTMS, post-rTMS in subjective eating disorder (ED) experiences. Weight, ED symptoms and mood were assessed pre-treatment, post-treatment and at 1month follow-up.
   ResultsIn both cases, there was improvement in ED symptomatology and mood after 19-20 sessions of neuronavigated rTMS, and these changes persisted or continued to improve at follow-up. Within sessions, Patient A demonstrated a consistent reduction in subjective ED experiences, and Patient B a reduction in some ED related experiences.
   ConclusionsThese findings suggest that rTMS has potential as an adjunct to the treatment of AN and deserves further study. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.

TI  - Non-pharmacological treatment for Parkinson disease patients with depression: a meta-analysis of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and cognitive-behavioral treatment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Nowadays, antidepressants still are the mainstay of treatment for depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) but some recent studies report that medication might aggravate motor symptoms in PD patients. This meta-analysis aims to assess the effect of non-pharmacological treatments for depression in patients with PD. Materials and Methods: Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The participants were PD patients with comorbid depression (dPD). The interventions had the equivalent effect of non-pharmacological treatments alone compared with control(s). Scores of depression scale were selected as the primary outcome, while scores of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III and the incidence of side effects were the secondary outcome. The statistics were pooled and presented as weighted mean differences (WMDs), standardized mean differences (SMDs), or risk ratios (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Fifteen articles were eventually included; twelve studies reported on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and three used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Other interventions failed to have qualified studies. Our data indicated that both rTMS and CBT could significantly improve depression scores in a short term (SMD = -0.621, 95% CI [-0.964, -0.278]; SMD = -1.148, 95% CI [-1.498, -0.798], respectively). In addition, rTMS could alleviate motor symptom (WMD = -2.617, 95% CI [-4.183, -1.051]) and was relatively safe (RR = 1.054, 95% CI [0.698, 1.592]). Conclusion: Our data suggest that rTMS can safely alleviate depression and motor symptoms in dPD at least for a short period. Moreover, compared with clinical monitoring, CBT can improve depressive symptoms.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for Alzheimer's disease: an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Objective Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative condition that significantly impacts both individuals and society. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for AD by summarizing the evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs). Methods SRs/MAs of rTMS for AD were collected by searching Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, CNKI, VIP, Sino-Med, and Wanfang databases. The search was conducted from database creation to January 23, 2024. Methodological quality, reporting quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Assessing Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). In addition, the quality of evidence for outcome measures was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Results Eight SRs/MAs included in this study met the inclusion criteria. Based on the AMSTAR-2, 4 of the SRs/MA were classified as low quality, while the remaining 4 were deemed to be of very low quality. The PRISMA analysis revealed that out of the 27 items reporting, 16 achieved full reporting (100%). However, there were still some deficiencies in reporting, particularly related to protocol and registration, search strategy, risk of bias, and additional analysis. The ROBIS tool indicated that only 3 SRs/MAs had a low risk of bias. The GRADE assessment indicated that 6 outcomes were of moderate quality (18.75%), 16 were of low quality (50%), and 10 were classified as very low quality (31.25%). Conclusion Based on the evidence collected, rTMS appears to be effective in improving cognitive function in AD patients, although the methodological quality of the SRs/MAs reduces the reliability of the conclusions and the overall quality is low. However, based on the available results, we still support the value of rTMS as an intervention to improve cognitive function in AD. In future studies, it is necessary to confirm the efficacy of rTMS in AD patients and provide more reliable and scientific data to contribute to evidence-based medicine.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-stroke depression: An overview of systematic reviews
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Objective: There is conflicting published research about the clinical effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of post-stroke depression (PSD). In order to provide trustworthy information for upcoming therapeutic treatments, this review attempts to compile and assess the data from pertinent systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
   Methods: The systematic evaluation of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-stroke depression was collected by searching CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Database, CBM, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The retrieval time is from database construction to September 2022. After selection, the included literature was evaluated for methodological quality, reporting quality, and evidence quality using AMSTAR2, PRISMA statements, and the GRADE system.
   Results: There were a total of 13 studies included, with three having generally comprehensive reporting according to the PRISMA statement, eight having some reporting issues, two having pretty substantial information issues, and 13 having extremely poor methodological quality according to the AMSTAR2. The GRADE was used to grade the quality of the evidence, and the included literature had 0 high-level evidence, eight medium-level evidence, 12 low-level evidence, and 22 very low-level evidence.
   Limitations: The results of this study are from researchers' subjective evaluation and only qualitative analysis, not quantitative evaluation. Although repeated cross-evaluation of researchers is carried out, the results will be personal. The interventions included in the study were complex, and it was impossible to analyze their e ect values quantitatively.
   Conclusion: Patients with post-stroke depression may benefit from repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, in terms of the quality of the reports, the methodology, and the quality of the evidence, published systematic evaluations/meta-analyses are of low quality. We list the drawbacks of the current clinical trials of repetitive transcranialmagnetic stimulation for post-stroke depression as well as potential therapeutic mechanisms. This information may serve as a guide for future clinical trials aiming to establish a solid foundation for the clinical efficacy of repetitive transcranialmagnetic stimulation in the treatment of post-stroke depression.

TI  - Does repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improve cognitive function in age-related neurodegenerative diseases? A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Objective: High-frequency, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeted over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is widely used in research to promote neuroplasticity and cognitive enhancement. RTMS is a promising intervention to tackle cognitive decline in people with age-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, there is currently no systematic evidence examining the effects of DLPFC- targeted, high- frequency rTMS on cognitive function in this population. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy and moderators of this treatment intervention.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search of five electronic databases was performed to identify articles published before October, 2022. Following PRISMA guidelines, the identified articles were screened, data was extracted, and the methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane tool, Risk of Bias 2. Meta-analyses were performed using R Studio (v.4.1.2).
   Results: Sixteen studies involving 474 participants met the inclusion criteria, of which 8 studies measured global cognitive function. The results from the random-effects meta-analysis showed rTMS significantly improved global cognitive function relative to control groups shown by a large, significant effect size (g = 1.39, 95% CI, 0.34-2.43; p = 0.017). No significant effects were found between subgroups or for individual cognitive domains.
   Conclusions: High-frequency rTMS, targeted over the DLPFC, appears to improve global cognitive function in people with age-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies included, and high between-study heterogeneity.

TI  - Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary state between normal aging and dementia. It has a high risk of progression in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique used to improve cognitive deficits in patients with MCI and AD. Although previous meta-analyses included studies carried on patients with MCI and AD, few studies have analyzed patients with MCI independently. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects and safety of rTMS on cognition function in patients with MCI and factors that may influence such effects.
   Methods: Data used in this study were searched and screened from different databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP), Wanfang Database, and China BioMedical Literature Database (SinoMed). The retrieved studies were carefully reviewed, data were extracted, and the quality of data was assessed.
   Results: A total of 12 studies involving 329 patients with MCI were included in the present meta-analysis. The analyses results revealed that rTMS improved cognitive function [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.44-1.22, p = 0.0009] and memory function (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.48-0.97, p < 0.00001) in the MCI + rTMS active group when compared to the sham stimulation group. The showed that: (1) cognitive improvement was more pronounced under high-frequency rTMS stimulation of multiple sites, such as the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and (2) more than 10 rTMS stimulation sessions produced higher improvement on cognition function in patients with MCI.
   Conclusions: This study shows that rTMS can improve cognitive function in patients with MCI, especially when applied at high frequency, multi-site, and for a prolonged period. However, further studies are required to validate these findings and explore more effective stimulation protocols and targets.

TI  - Treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia using transcranial magnetic stimulation: a systematic review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS
AB  - Objective:Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are a group of noncognitive symptoms that occur commonly among individuals with dementia. These symptoms worsen the morbidity and mortality among individuals with dementia and significantly increase the cost of caring for these individuals. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been shown to have some benefits in the treatment of BPSD. This review provides an updated summary of the effect of TMS on BPSD. Methods:We conducted a systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane, and Ovid databases on the use of TMS to treat BPSD. Results:We found 11 randomized controlled studies that evaluated the use of TMS among individuals with BPSD. Three of these studies examined the effect of TMS on apathy, two of which showed significant benefit. Seven studies showed that TMS significantly improves BPSD: six using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and one using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Four studies, two evaluating tDCS, one evaluating rTMS, and one evaluating intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) showed a nonsignificant impact of TMS on BPSD. Adverse events were predominantly mild and transitory in all studies. Conclusion:Available data from this review indicate that rTMS is beneficial for individuals with BPSD, especially among individuals with apathy, and is well tolerated. However, more data are needed to prove the efficacy of tDCS and iTBS. Additionally, more randomized controlled trials with longer treatment follow-up and standardized use of BPSD assessments are needed to determine the best dose, duration, and modality for effective treatment of BPSD.

TI  - Effect of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on major depressive disorder in patients with Parkinson's disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) occurs in a small proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and reduces their quality of life. We performed a randomized sham-controlled study to evaluate the effect of high-frequency (HF) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on MDD in patients with PD. Ten patients participated to a real-rTMS group and eight patients to a sham-rTMS group. Evaluations were performed at baseline, 2 and 6 weeks after rTMS treatment. All participants underwent examinations of depression rating scales, including the Hamilton Rating Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the motor part of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III). The real-rTMS group had improved scores on HRS and the MADRS after 10 sessions, and these beneficial effects persisted for 6 weeks after the initial session. The BDI score did not change immediately after the sessions. The sham-rTMS group had no significant changes in any of the depression rating scales. The UPDRS-III did not change in either group. HF-rTMS of the left DLPFC is an effective treatment for MDD in patients with PD.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to improve mood and motor function in Parkinson's disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
CP  - International Symposium on Dementia in Parkinson's Disease
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can produce lasting changes in excitability and activity in cortical regions underneath the stimulation coil (local effect), but also within functionally connected cortical or subcortical regions (remote effects). Since the clinical presentation of Parkinson's disease (PD) is related to abnormal neuronal activity within the basal ganglia and cortical regions, including the primary motor cortex, the premotor cortex and the prefrontal cortex, several studies have used rTMS to improve brain function in PD. Here, we review the studies that have investigated the possible therapeutic effects of rTMS on mood and motor function in PD patients. We highlight some methodological inconsistencies and problems, including the difficulty to define the most effective protocol for rTMS or to establish an appropriate placebo condition. We finally propose future directions of research that may help to improve the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS in PD. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of rTMS treatment on global cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Although repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been extensively studied in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the clinical evidence remains inconsistent. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of rTMS on global cognitive function in patients with AD. Methods: An integrated literature search using 4 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library) was performed to identify English language articles published up to October 6, 2021. We pooled Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) scores using a random-effects model via RevMan 5.4 software. We calculated estimates of mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary outcomes were pre-post treatment changes in global cognition as measured using MMSE and ADAS-Cog immediately after rTMS treatment, and the secondary outcome was duration of cognitive improvement (1-1.5 and >= 3 months). Results: Nine studies with 361 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that rTMS significantly improved global cognitive function immediately following rTMS treatment [(MD) 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41-2.22, p < 0.00001, MMSE; 2.72, 95% CI, 1.77-3.67, p < 0.00001, ADAS-Cog], and the therapeutic effects persisted for an extended duration (2.20, 95% CI, 0.93-3.47, p =0.0007, MMSE; 1.96, 95% CI, 0.96-2.95, p = 0.0001, ADAS-Cog). Subgroup analyses showed that high frequency rTMS targeted to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for over 20 sessions induced the greatest cognitive improvement, with effects lasting for more than 1 month after the final treatment. There were no significant differences in dropout rate (p > 0.05) or adverse effect rate (p > 0.05) between the rTMS and control groups. Conclusions: Repetitive TMS is a potentially effective treatment for cognitive impairment in AD that is safe and can induce long-lasting effects. Our results also showed that ADAS-cog and MMSE differed in determination of global cognitive impairment.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation may be superior to drug therapy in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis
T2  - CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
AB  - BackgroundRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation therapy that is primarily used to treat a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions. Recently, previous research reports stated that rTMS have the characteristics of neurorestorative in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relevant clinical research evidence has not been fully summarized. MethodsThis article performed a network meta-analysis of individual participant data from eligible studies searched in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to March 31, 2022. The drug treatments involved were acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), anti-amyloid-beta (A beta), and some new targeted therapeutic drugs. ResultsA total of 15, 548 individuals with AD disease in 57 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included in this meta-analysis. The results indicated that the patients who received rTMS treatment (standard mean difference [SMD]: 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22-1.07) had a better MMSE score than placebo. Treatment outcome analysis showed that, compared with multiple pharmacological interventions, rTMS acquired the greatest probability rank with the best cognitive improvement in MMSE score [the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) 93.3%] and ADAS-cog score (SUCRA 86.7%). At the same time, rTMS treatment had the lowest rank in the adverse events (SUCRA 24.1%) except for the placebo group (SUCRA 19.1%). ConclusionCompared with the current clinical drug treatment, rTMS demonstrated better cognitive function improvement and fewer adverse events in AD patients. Therefore, rTMS shows broad prospects in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and it is worth being widely popularized in clinic.

TI  - Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Motor Symptoms in Parkinson Disease A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - JAMA NEUROLOGY
AB  - IMPORTANCE Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique that has been closely examined as a possible treatment for Parkinson disease (PD). However, results evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS in PD are mixed, mostly owing to low statistical power or variety in individual rTMS protocols.
   OBJECTIVES To determine the rTMS effects on motor dysfunction in patients with PD and to examine potential factors that modulate the rTMS effects.
   DATA SOURCES Databases searched included PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from inception to June 30, 2014.
   STUDY SELECTION Eligible studies included sham-controlled, randomized clinical trials of rTMS intervention for motor dysfunction in patients with PD.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Relevant measures were extracted independently by 2 investigators. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated with random-effects models.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Motor examination of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.
   RESULTS Twenty studies with a total of 470 patients were included. Random-effects analysis revealed a pooled SMD of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.29-0.64), indicating an overall medium effect size favoring active rTMS over sham rTMS in the reduction of motor symptoms (P < .001). Subgroup analysis showed that the effect sizes estimated from high-frequency rTMS targeting the primary motor cortex (SMD, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.46-1.08; P < .001) and low-frequency rTMS applied over other frontal regions (SMD, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.13-0.87; P = .008) were significant. The effect sizes obtained from the other 2 combinations of rTMS frequency and rTMS site (ie, high-frequency rTMS at other frontal regions: SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.48, and low primary motor cortex: SMD, 0.28; 95% CI, -0.23 to 0.78) were not significant. Meta-regression revealed that a greater number of pulses per session or across sessions is associated with larger rTMS effects. Using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria, we characterized the quality of evidence presented in this meta-analysis as moderate quality.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The pooled evidence suggests that rTMS improves motor symptoms for patients with PD. Combinations of rTMS site and frequency as well as the number of rTMS pulses are key modulators of rTMS effects. The findings of our meta-analysis may guide treatment decisions and inform future research.

TI  - Predictors of remission after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of late-life depression
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment in patients with depression, yet treatment response remains variable. While previous work has identified predictors of remission in younger adults, relatively little data exists in late-life depression (LLD). To address this gap, data from 164 participants with LLD from a randomized non-inferiority treatment trial comparing standard bilateral rTMS to bilateral theta burst stimulation (TBS) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02998580) were analyzed using binary logistic regression and conditional inference tree (CIT) modeling. Lower baseline depression symptom severity, fewer prior antidepressant treatment failures, and higher global cognition predicted remission following rTMS treatment. The CIT predicted a higher likelihood of achieving remission for patients with a total score of 19 or lower on the Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale, 1 or fewer prior antidepressant treatment failures, and a total score of 23 or higher on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Our results indicate that older adults with lower severity of depression, fewer antidepressant treatment failures, and higher global cognition benefit more from current forms of rTMS. The results suggest that there is potentially higher value in using rTMS earlier in the treatment pathway for depression in older adults.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cognitive Effects of rTMS in Caucasian Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - In recent years, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has received much attention as a non-invasive, effective treatment modality for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Although several meta-analyses have reported that rTMS can improve cognitive abilities, improvements in individual memory domains (speech, language, concentration, and memory) are poorly understood. In addition, stimulation parameters may be flawed in studies of global populations because of ethnic differences between Caucasians and Asians. This meta-analysis aimed to systematically characterize the efficacy of different combinations of rTMS parameters on different cognitive domains in Caucasian patients with MCI. We conducted a systematic literature search in Medline PubMed, Pubpsych, and Embase on the use of rTMS in MCI patients through November 2022. Randomized, double-blind, and sham-controlled trials (RCTs) from the Caucasian patient population were included. The studies reported outcome measures for different domains of cognition, such as language, concentration, or memory. Possible effects of covariates were examined using meta-regressions. The search yielded five publications. The analyses found that rTMS improved cognitive functions, memory, concentration, and language in patients with MCI and treatment with rTMS compared with the sham stimulation group. The statistical analysis results of the studies showed that rTMS could improve various cognitive functions, such as memory and concentration, in Caucasian MCI patients. A particular effect was found at a frequency of 10 Hz and stimulation of the LDLPFC. However, further studies are needed to validate these findings and explore more effective stimulation protocols and targets.

TI  - The use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of spasticity
T2  - NEUROTHERAPY: PROGRESS IN RESTORATIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND NEUROLOGY
CP  - 25th International Summer School of Brain Research
AB  - Spasticity is a common disorder in patients with injury of the brain and spinal cord, especially in patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, spasticity is a major cause of long-term disability, it significantly impacts daily activities and quality of life and is only partially influenced by traditional spasmolytic drugs. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive tool that can be used to modulate cortical excitability of the leg motor area, inducing remote effects on the excitability of the spinal circuits. The H reflex is a reliable electrophysiologic measure of the stretch reflex, and has been used in previous studies to test the effects of rTMS of the motor cortex on spinal circuitry. Based on these premises, originating from physiological studies in normal subjects, some studies have demonstrated that rTMS of the leg motor cortex can be beneficial in the management of spasticity by enhancing corticospinal tract excitability and reducing H reflex amplitude.

TI  - Effect of different modalities of transcranial magnetic stimulation on Parkinson's patients cognitive impairment and long-term effectiveness: a systematic review and network meta-analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Objective: This study used network Meta-analysis to compare the effects of different transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) modalities on the effectiveness and long-term validity of improving cognitive function in Parkinson's patients. Methods: Computer searches of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Embass, CNKI and Wanfang Data were conducted to collect randomized controlled clinical studies on TMS to improve cognitive function in Parkinson's patients published from the time of library construction to December 2023. Results: A total of 22 studies and 1,473 patients were included, comprising 5 interventions: high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS), low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS), intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), sham stimulation and conventional rehabilitation therapy (CRT). Network Meta-analysis showed that the ranking results of different TMS intervention modalities in terms of MoCA scores were: HF-rTMS > LF-rTMS > iTBS > sham > CRT, the ranking results of different TMS intervention modalities in terms of MMSE scores were: HF-rTMS > LF-rTMS > sham > CRT. The effect of TMS on improving Parkinsonian cognitive function lasted for 1 month compared to the no-stimulation group. Conclusion: TMS has some long-term sustained effects on improving cognitive function in Parkinson's patients. HF-rTMS is more effective in improving cognitive function in Parkinson's patients.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Applications in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review
T2  - BEZMIALEM SCIENCE
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), is characterized by its progressive feature and loss of cognitive functions, is common among dementia types. There is no curative treatment of the disease today. In recent years, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques together with drug therapy have been explored by experts considering that they will produce beneficial results. Repetetive TMS (rTMS) can modulate cortical excitability and prevent long-term neuroplastic changes. The aim of this study is an updated and comprehensive systematic review of studies using TMS/rTMS in AD patients. Our study was designed as a systematic review prepared according to the PRISMA guideline. In this study, English and Turkish AD-TMS articles that entered the literature published between 2002 and 2017 were included. Randomized and non-randomized controlled clinical studies on humans evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS applications at different concentrations, durations and different regions in AD have been reviewed. The databases we used were Pubmed (R), MEDLINE (R), Webofscience (R), EMBASE (R), Turkiye Atif Dizini (R). Keywords were "TMS, rTMS, Alzheimers Disease" used in our search, 116 artticles complied with the determined protocol were identified and 14 were included in our study. The studies presented in this review, show the therapeutic potential of rTMS in AD patients. Benefits of rTMS were to communicate with patients and especially caregivers in their daily activities, thereby improving their QoL. The possibility of using TMS to increase neuroplasticity is promising not only to improve our understanding of brain plasticity mechanisms, but also to design new neurorehabilitation strategies.

TI  - Cognitive effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with neurodegenerative diseases - Clinician's perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) represents a promising tool for studying and influencing cognition in people with neurodegenerative diseases. This procedure is noninvasive and painless, and it does not require the use of anesthesia or pharmacological substances. In this systematic critical review we report outcomes from research focused on behavioral cognitive effects induced by rTMS in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) preceding AD. There are still major limitations to rTMS use, such as a poor understanding of its after-effects and inter-individual variability in their magnitude, discrepancies in stimulation protocols and study designs, varied selection of the specific stimulated areas and control procedures, and neuropsychological methods for assessment of after-effects; hence, the results of the present research can only be considered preliminary. The future directions are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation as a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Tool in Various Types of Dementia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Dementia is recognized as a healthcare and social burden and remains challenging in terms of proper diagnosis and treatment. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in various neurological diseases that noninvasively investigates cortical excitability and connectivity and can induce brain plasticity. This article reviews findings on TMS in common dementia types as well as therapeutic results. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by increased cortical excitability and reduced cortical inhibition, especially as mediated by cholinergic neurons and as documented by impairment of short latency inhibition (SAI). In vascular dementia, excitability is also increased. SAI may have various outcomes, which probably reflects its frequent overlap with AD. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is associated with SAI decrease. Motor cortical excitability is usually normal, reflecting the lack of corticospinal tract involvement. DLB and other dementia types are also characterized by impairment of short interval intracortical inhibition. In frontotemporal dementia, cortical excitability is increased, but SAI is normal. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has the potential to improve cognitive function. It has been extensively studied in AD, showing promising results after multisite stimulation. TMS with electroencephalography recording opens new possibilities for improving diagnostic accuracy; however, more studies are needed to support the existing data.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Several studies have demonstrated that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may have a beneficial effect in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the clinical benefit of rTMS for AD remains inconclusive.
   Objective
   This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rTMS in AD.
   Methods
   We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rTMS for AD. We calculated pooled estimates of mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The protocol was registered at International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (number CRD42018089990).
   Results
   Five RCTs involving 148 participants were included in this review. Compared with sham stimulation, high-frequency rTMS led to a significant improvement in cognition as measured by ADAS-cog (MD =-3.65, 95% CI-5.82 to-1.48, p = 0.001), but not MMSE (MD = 0.49, 95% CI -1.45 to 2.42, p = 0.62). High-frequency rTMS also improved the global impression in comparison to the placebo (MD =-0.79, 95% CI-1.24 to-0.34, p = 0.0006). There was no significant difference in mood (MD =-1.36, 95% CI-3.93 to 1.21, p = 0.30) and functional performance (MD = 0.59, 95% CI-1.21 to 2.38, p = 0.52) between high-frequency rTMS and sham groups. Only one trial included low-frequency rTMS reported no significant improvement in cognition, mood and functional performance. Few mild adverse events were observed in both the rTMS and sham groups.
   Conclusions
   RTMS is relatively well tolerated, with some promise for cognitive improvement and global impression in patients with AD. Our findings also indicate the variability between ADAS-cog and MMSE in evaluating global cognitive impairment.

TI  - The impact of transcranial magnetic stimulation on diagnostic confidence in patients with Alzheimer disease
T2  - ALZHEIMERS RESEARCH & THERAPY
AB  - Background: Cholinergic dysfunction is a key abnormality in Alzheimer disease (AD) that can be detected in vivo with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols. Although TMS has clearly demonstrated analytical validity, its clinical utility is still debated. In the present study, we evaluated the incremental diagnostic value, expressed in terms of diagnostic confidence of Alzheimer disease (DCAD; range 0-100), of TMS measures in addition to the routine clinical diagnostic assessment in patients evaluated for cognitive impairment as compared with validated biomarkers of amyloidosis.
   Methods: One hundred twenty patients with dementia were included and scored in terms of DCAD in a three-step assessment based on (1) demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological evaluations (clinical work-up); (2) clinical work-up plus amyloid markers (cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid positron emission tomographic imaging); and (3) clinical work-up plus TMS intracortical connectivity measures. Two blinded neurologists were asked to review the diagnosis and diagnostic confidence at each step.
   Results: TMS measures increased the discrimination of DCAD in two clusters (AD-like vs FTD-like) when added to the clinical and neuropsychological evaluations with levels comparable to established biomarkers of brain amyloidosis (cluster distance of 55.1 for clinical work-up alone, 76.0 for clinical work-up plus amyloid markers, 80.0 for clinical work-up plus TMS). Classification accuracy for the "gold standard" diagnosis (dichotomous - AD vs FID variable) evaluated in the three-step assessment, expressed as AUC, increased from 0.82 (clinical work-up alone) to 0.98 (clinical work-up plus TMS) and to 0.99 (clinical work-up plus amyloidosis markers).
   Conclusions: TMS in addition to routine assessment in patients with dementia has a significant effect on diagnosis and diagnostic confidence that is comparable to well-established amyloidosis biomarkers.

TI  - Noninvasive brain stimulation for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background Pharmacological and conventional nonpharmacological treatments for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) have only modest efficacy. Furthermore, pharmacotherapy carries the risk of important side effects. Noninvasive brain stimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)) are valuable and safe for cognitive function in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, there have been few studies, and there is no consensus, regarding the use of these techniques to treat BPSD. Methods We performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of studies reporting the effect of rTMS or tDCS on BPSD. Results Seven articles were included: five randomized, controlled clinical trials and two open-label clinical trials. Five studies investigated the effects of rTMS and two the effects of tDCS. Both studies using tDCS reported no evidence of efficacy on BPSD, while two of the three RCTs using rTMS found statistically significant benefits. In an exploratory meta-analysis with four of the RCT studies, we did not find evidence of efficacy of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, with an overall effect of -0.02 (95% CI = -0.90, 0.94; I-2 = 85%). However, when we used only the data from the studies that applied rTMS, we found a positive effect on BPSD, with an overall effect of -0.58 (95% CI = -1.02, -0.14; I-2 = 0%). With regards to the adverse effects reported, these were mild and not clinically relevant. Conclusions Our results establish a tendency for efficacy of rTMS protocols on BPSD, while corroborating their safety and tolerability, suggesting the need for further research.

TI  - Effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on episodic memory in patients with subjective cognitive decline: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Early decline of episodic memory is detectable in subjective cognitive decline (SCD). The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with encoding episodic memories. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel and viable tool to improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment, but the treatment effect in SCD has not been studied. We aim to investigate the efficacy of rTMS on episodic memory in individuals with SCD, and to explore the potential mechanisms of neural plasticity.Methods: In our randomized, sham-controlled trial, patients (n = 60) with SCD will receive 20 sessions (5 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks) of real rTMS (n = 30) or sham rTMS (n = 30) over the left DLPFC. The primary outcome is the Auditory Verbal Learning Test-Huashan version (AVLT-H). Other neuropsychological examinations and the long-term potentiation (LTP)-like cortical plasticity evaluation serve as the secondary outcomes. These outcomes will be assessed before and at the end of the intervention.Discussion: If the episodic memory of SCD improve after the intervention, the study will confirm that rTMS is a promising intervention for cognitive function improvement on the early stage of dementia. This study will also provide important clinical evidence for early intervention in AD and emphasizes the significance that impaired LTP-like cortical plasticity may be a potential biomarker of AD prognosis by demonstrating the predictive role of LTP on cognitive improvement in SCD.Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the hospital (No. 2023-002-01). The results will be published in peer-review publications.

TI  - Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in the Rehabilitation of Communication and Deglutition Disorders: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - FOLIA PHONIATRICA ET LOGOPAEDICA
AB  - Objective: To systematically review randomized controlled trials that evaluate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on rehabilitation aspects related to communication and swallowing functions. Methods: A search was conducted on PubMed, Clinical Trials, Cochrane Library, and ASHA electronic databases. Studies were judged according to the eligibility criteria and analyzed by 2 independent and blinded researchers. Results: We analyzed 9 studies: 4 about aphasia, 3 about dysphagia, 1 about dysarthria in Parkinson's disease and 1 about linguistic deficits in Alzheimer's disease. All aphasia studies used low-frequency rTMS to stimulate Broca's homologous area. High-frequency rTMS was applied over the pharyngoesophageal cortex from the left and/or right hemisphere in the dysphagia studies and over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's studies. Two aphasia and all dysphagia studies showed a significant improvement of the disorder, compared to the sham group. The other 2 studies related to aphasia found a benefit restricted to subgroups with a severe case or injury on the anterior portion of the language cortical area, respectively, whereas the Alzheimer's study demonstrated positive effects specific to auditory comprehension. There were no changes for vocal function in the Parkinson's study. Conclusion: The benefits of the technique and its applicability in neurogenic disorders related to communication and deglutition are still uncertain. Therefore, other randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the optimal stimulation protocol for each disorder studied and its real effects. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on depression and cognition in individuals with traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA-approved therapy in major depressive disorder. However, its treatment efficacy on depression after traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains inconclusive. We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of executing rTMS over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on depression, cognitive impairment and post-concussion syndrome in individuals with traumatic brain injury. This study contained seven randomized controlled trials that published before April 5, 2020 in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. The rTMS had significant anti-depressant effect (SMD = 1.03, p = 0.02), but the effects dissipated at 1-month follow-up (SMD = 0.39, p = 0.62). In the subgroup analysis, only applying rTMS to left DLPFC area of post-TBI patients showed significant anti-depressant effect (SMD = 0.98, p = 0.04). Moreover, current data observed that rTMS on post-TBI patients possessed substantial improvement in visuospatial memory (SMD = 0.39, p < 0.0001), but wasn't in processing speed (SMD = - 0.18, p = 0.32) and selective attention (SMD = 0.21, p = 0.31). In addition, the effect of rTMS is not superior to sham on postconcussion syndrome. In conclusion, the short-term antidepressant effect of left DLPFC rTMS in patients with TBI was significant. However, the effectiveness of rTMS on cognition and postconcussion syndrome in patients with post-TBI depression was limited.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in memory deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease: Meta-analysis and systematic review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are two of the most used non-pharmacological interventions for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, most of the clinical trials have focused on evaluating the effects on global cognition and not on specific cognitive functions. Therefore, considering that memory loss is one of the hallmark symptoms of AD, we aim to assess the efficacy and safety of tDCS and rTMS in memory deficits. For that, multilevel random effect models were performed considering the standardized mean difference (SMD) between active and sham stimulation. A total of 19 studies with 411 participants demonstrated positive effects in memory after tDCS (SMD=0.20, p = 0.04) and rTMS (SMD=0.44, p = 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that tDCS had greater efficacy when administered in temporal regions (SMD=0.32, p = 0.04), whereas rTMS was superior when applied in frontal regions (SMD=0.61, p < 0.001). Therefore, depending on the brain region of stimulation, both interventions produced a positive effect on memory symptoms in AD patients. Finally, the safety of both techniques was observed in the AD population after the reporting of almost no serious events.

TI  - Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of the Brain After Ischemic Stroke: Mechanisms from Animal Models
T2  - CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Stroke is a common cerebrovascular disease with high morbidity, mortality, and disability worldwide. Post-stroke dysfunction is related to the death of neurons and impairment of synaptic structure, which results from cerebral ischemic damage. Currently, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques are available to provide clinically effective interventions and quantitative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The development of TMS has been 40 years and a range of repetitive TMS (rTMS) protocols are now available to regulate neuronal plasticity in many neurological disorders, such as stroke, Parkinson disease, psychiatric disorders, Alzheimer disease, and so on. Basic studies in an animal model with ischemic stroke are significant for demonstrating potential mechanisms of neural restoration induced by rTMS. In this review, the mechanisms were summarized, involving synaptic plasticity, neural cell death, neurogenesis, immune response, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in vitro and vivo experiments with ischemic stroke models. Those findings can contribute to the understanding of how rTMS modulated function recovery and the exploration of novel therapeutic targets.

TI  - The Neuroprotective Role of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Short Review on Experimental Studies
T2  - MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - There are rapidly replicating human data suggesting the therapeutic and neurorestorative role of transcranial magnetic stimulation in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. However there are only limited experimental studies in the literature enlighting the neurobiological mechanisms of this technique. In the light of these findings, we aimed to review the neuroprotective effect of rTMS in various animal studies. We have shown that rTMS may exert significant neuroprotective effect through acting on the neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and A beta aggregation.

TI  - Effectiveness of the prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on cognitive profiles in depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective clinical intervention for various neuropsychiatric diseases. However, it is still unclear whether rTMS has an effect on cognitive functioning. In this review, we aimed to systematically evaluate the cognitive effects of rTMS in depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. We searched PubMed (1996-2018) under the set terms to review randomized controlled trials (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of rTMS administered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and evaluated cognitive functions in patients with depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. Two authors reviewed each article and came to consensus on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All eligible studies were reviewed, duplicates were removed, and data were extracted individually. The search identified 579 articles, 31 of which met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among them, 15 were conducted in patients with depression, 11 in patients with schizophrenia, and 5 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, 6 studies demonstrated a significant improvement of executive function across these diseases. Further, no evidence for cognitive adverse effects was found in these included rTMS studies. Although the heterogeneity between studies in terms of cognitive measures applied, stimulation parameters, and participants limits the ability to generalize conclusions, this review demonstrated that prefrontal rTMS could exert pro-cognitive effects on executive function and attention in some patients with depression but inconsistent cognitive impacts in any of the examined domains especially in patients with schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. The results warrant further rTMS studies that include systematic assessment of cognition across various neuropsychiatric diseases.

TI  - A Review of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in the in vivo Functional Evaluation of Central Cholinergic Circuits in Dementia
T2  - DEMENTIA AND GERIATRIC COGNITIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Central cholinergic circuits of human brain can be tested non-invasively by coupling electrical peripheral stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex. The short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) is reduced in cholinergic forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, while it is normal in non-cholinergic forms of dementia, such as frontotemporal dementia. This finding suggests that this method can be used as a non-invasive additional tool for discriminating between cholinergic and non-cholinergic forms of dementia. Interestingly, SAI was also found to be significantly smaller in early AD patients. Identification of SAI abnormalities that occur early in the course of AD will allow earlier diagnosis and treatment with cholinergic drugs. In patients with vascular dementia, SAI responses varied widely; the number of patients with abnormal SAI conceivably reflects the percentage of subjects with a significant cholinergic dysfunction. It has recently been demonstrated that brain microbleeds have an impact on SAI that is independent of the extent of associated white matter changes and ischemic stroke. Since SAI can be increased by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, TMS may help in identifying the patients who would be suitable for long-term treatment with cholinergic agents. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

TI  - Toward a Glutamate Hypothesis of Frontotemporal Dementia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogenous neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by diverse clinical presentations, neuropathological characteristics and underlying genetic causes. Emerging evidence has shown that FTD is characterized by a series of changes in several neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin, dopamine, GABA and, above all, glutamate. Indeed, several studies have now provided preclinical and clinical evidence that glutamate is key in the pathogenesis of FTD. Animal models of FTD have shown a selective hypofunction in N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, while in patients, glutamatergic pyramidal neurons are depleted in several areas, including the frontal and temporal cortices. Recently, a selective involvement of the AMPA GluA3 subunit has been observed in patients with autoimmune anti-GluA3 antibodies, which accounted for nearly 25% of FTD patients, leading to a decrease of the GluA3 subunit synaptic localization of the AMPA receptor and loss of dendritic spines. Other in vivo evidence of the involvement of the glutamatergic system in FTD derives from non-invasive brain stimulation studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation, in which specific stimulation protocols have indirectly identified a selective and prominent impairment in glutamatergic circuits in patients with both sporadic and genetic FTD. In view of limited disease modifying therapies to slow or revert disease progression in FTD, an important approach could consist in targeting the neurotransmitter deficits, similarly to what has been achieved in Parkinson's disease with dopaminergic therapy or Alzheimer's disease with cholinergic therapy. In this review, we summarize the current evidence concerning the involvement of the glutamatergic system in FTD, suggesting the development of new therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Stimulating Memory: Reviewing Interventions Using Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to Enhance or Restore Memory Abilities
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - Human memory systems are imperfect recording devices that are affected by age and disease, but recent findings suggest that the functionality of these systems may be modifiable through interventions using non-invasive brain stimulation such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The translational potential of these rTMS interventions is clear: memory problems are the most common cognitive complaint associated with healthy aging, while pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease are often associated with severe deficits in memory. Therapies to improve memory or treat memory loss could enhance independence while reducing costs for public health systems. Despite this promise, several important factors limit the generalizability and translational potential of rTMS interventions for memory. Heterogeneity of protocol design, rTMS parameters, and outcome measures present significant challenges to interpretation and reproducibility. However, recent advances in cognitive neuroscience, including rTMS approaches and recent insights regarding functional brain networks, may offer methodological tools necessary to design new interventional studies with enhanced experimental rigor, improved reproducibility, and greater likelihood of successful translation to clinical settings. In this review, we first discuss the current state of the literature on memory modulation with rTMS, then offer a commentary on developments in cognitive neuroscience that are relevant to rTMS interventions, and finally close by offering several recommendations for the design of future investigations using rTMS to modulate human memory performance.

TI  - Use of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in the Treatment of Neuropsychiatric and Neurocognitive Symptoms Associated With Concussion in Military Populations
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEAD TRAUMA REHABILITATION
AB  - Background:
   Since the year 2000, over 342 000 military service members have experienced a concussion, often associated with chronic neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive symptoms. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols have been developed for many of these symptoms in the general population.
   Objective:
   To conduct a scoping review of the literature on rTMS for neuropsychological and neurocognitive symptoms following concussion.
   Methods:
   PubMed and Google Scholar search engines identified 9 articles, written in English, corresponding to the search terms TBI or concussion; and TMS or rTMS; and depression, PTSD, or cognition. Studies that were not therapeutic trials or case reports, did not have neuropsychiatric or neurocognitive primary outcome measures, or described samples where 80% or more of the cohort did not have a TBI were excluded.
   Results:
   There were no reports of seizures nor difference in the frequency or quality of other adverse events as compared with the broader rTMS literature, supporting the safety of rTMS in this population. Support for the efficacy of rTMS for the treatment of neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive symptoms, in this population, is limited.
   Conclusions:
   Large-scale, innovative, neuroscience-informed protocols are recommended to elucidate the potential utility of rTMS for the complex neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive symptoms associated with military concussions.

TI  - Open-Label, Short-Term, Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Patients With Alzheimer's Disease With Functional Imaging Correlates and Literature Review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE AND OTHER DEMENTIAS
AB  - Background: Accumulating evidence suggests repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be beneficial in ameliorating cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   Methods: AD patients received four high-frequency rTMS sessions over the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) over two weeks. Structured cognitive assessments were administered at baseline, at 2 weeks after completion of rTMS, and at 4 weeks post treatment. At these same times, tolerant patients underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing structured motor and cognitive tasks. We also reviewed literature regarding the effects of rTMS on cognitive function in AD.
   Results: A total of 12 patients were enrolled, eight of whom tolerated the fMRI. Improvement was seen in Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination tests of verbal and non-verbal agility 4 weeks post-treatment. The fMRI analysis showed trends for increased activation during cognitive performance tasks immediately after and at 4 weeks post-treatment. Our literature review revealed several double-blind, sham-controlled studies, all showing sustained improvement in cognition of AD patients with rTMS.
   Conclusions: There was improvement in aspects of language after four rTMS treatments, sustained a month after treatment cessation. Our results are consistent with other studies and standardization of treatment protocols using functional imaging may be of benefit.

TI  - The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: a protocol for a randomized, controlled three-arm trial
T2  - BMC NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) carries a high risk of progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Previous clinical trials testing whether cholinesterase inhibitors can slow the rate of progression from MCI to AD dementia have yielded disappointing results. However, recent studies of the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in AD have demonstrated improvements in cognitive function. Because few rTMS trials have been conducted in MCI, we designed a trial to test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in MCI. Yet, in both MCI and AD, we know little about what site of stimulation would be ideal for improving cognitive function. Therefore, two cortical sites will be investigated in this trial: (1) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which has been well studied for treatment of major depressive disorder; and (2) the lateral parietal cortex (LPC), a novel site with connectivity to AD-relevant limbic regions.
   Methods/design: In this single-site trial, we plan to enroll 99 participants with single or multi-domain amnestic MCI. We will randomize participants to one of three groups: (1) Active DLPFC rTMS; (2) Active LPC rTMS; and (3) Sham rTMS (evenly split between DLPFC and LPC locations). After completing 20 bilateral rTMS treatment sessions, participants will be followed for 6 months to test short-term efficacy and track durability of effects. The primary efficacy measure is the California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II), assessed 1 week after intervention. Secondary analyses will examine effects of rTMS on other cognitive measures, symptoms of depression, and brain function with respect to the site of stimulation. Finally, selected biomarkers will be analyzed to explore predictors of response and mechanisms of action.
   Discussion: The primary aim of this trial is to test the short-term efficacy of rTMS in MCI. Additionally, the project will provide information on the durability of cognitive effects and potentially distinct effects of stimulating DLPFC versus LPC regions. Future efforts would be directed toward better understanding therapeutic mechanisms and optimizing rTMS for treatment of MCI. Ultimately, if rTMS can be utilized to slow the rate of progression to AD dementia, this will be a significant advancement in the field.

TI  - Clinical Efficacy of Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Psychiatric and Cognitive Disorders: Protocol for a Systematic Review
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely used noninvasive brain stimulation technique for psychiatric and cognitive disorders. In recent years, deep TMS (dTMS) has shown promise as an enhanced form of TMS able to stimulate deeper brain structures and target broader networks. Various magnetic Hesed-coil (H-coil) designs-a novel feature of dTMS-have been used to stimulate brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of specific psychiatric and cognitive disorders, thereby producing therapeutic effects. Given the novelty of dTMS in psychiatry, little is known about the clinical efficacy of dTMS across psychiatric and cognitive disorders-that is, whether dTMS performs superiorly to sham or control.Objective: In this paper, we outline a protocol for a systematic review investigating the clinical efficacy of dTMS. The primary objective is to conduct a systematic review of the literature on dTMS for psychiatric and cognitive disorders and, if feasible, a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of active dTMS versus sham/control for psychiatric disorders. Dementia and related cognitive disorders will also be examined. A secondary objective will be to examine subgroup differences (by age, sex, H-coil design, and dTMS parameters [ie, pulses per session, percentage of motor threshold, etc]) to evaluate whether dTMS differentially influences clinical outcomes based on these factors.Methods: A comprehensive search of the APA PsycINFO, Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases will be conducted using keywords such as "H-coil" and "dTMS." Two authors (AD and MD) will be responsible for screening relevant articles, assessing article eligibility (according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria), and data extraction. All included articles will undergo a quality and risk of bias assessment. Data from included articles will be summarized qualitatively in a systematic review. If a sufficient number of equivalent studies are available, a meta-analysis will be performed to (1) determine the effect of active versus sham dTMS (or another control arm) across psychiatric and cognitive disorders, and (2) examine subgroup effects of clinical outcomes.Results: The preliminary search rendered a total of 1134 articles from the APA PsycINFO, Embase, and MEDLINE databases. After full-text screening, 21 eligible articles remained. One additional article was identified from the references section of an existing systematic review. In total, 22 eligible articles were included. Data extraction and quality of assessment procedures are ongoing.Conclusions: We will outline the evidence relating to the clinical efficacy of dTMS in various psychiatric and cognitive disorders. The results of the prospective systematic review will provide clinicians with valuable insight into the clinical (ie, participant age, sex, psychiatric or cognitive disorder, etc) and methodological factors (ie, H-coil design, dTMS parameters, etc) which may contribute to dTMS efficacy, and thereby may assist clinicians in their decision to prescribe dTMS for specific psychiatric and cognitive disorders.Trial Registration: PROSPERO CRD42022360066; https://tinyurl.com/5ev6byrn International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/45213(JMIR Res Protoc 2023;12:e45213) doi: 10.2196/45213

TI  - Effects of Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) on Cognitive Impairment in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer Disease A Meta-analysis
T2  - ALZHEIMER DISEASE & ASSOCIATED DISORDERS
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the beneficial effects and optimal stimulation protocol of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched until March 2020. The cognitive outcomes were extracted and the standardized mean difference with 95% confidence interval was calculated. Results: Twenty-eight studies were included. The result of NIBS showed significant effect on global cognition (P<0.05). Low-frequency rTMS over right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) over left DLPFC, and the tDCS over left DLPFC and temporal lobe can significantly improve the memory function (P<0.05). HF-rTMS over left, right, or bilateral DLPFC can significantly improve the language function (P<0.05). Both HF-rTMS and tDCS over left DLPFC can obviously improve the executive function (P<0.05). Multiple sessions of rTMS with 80% to 100% intensity and anode tDCS with 2 mA current density are more suitable for all these functions. Conclusions: NIBS has a beneficial effect on cognitive performance in both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease patients. Distinct optimal stimulation parameters were observed for different cognitive functions.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation on cognition in mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's disease-related dementias, and other cognitive disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOGERIATRICS
AB  - Objective: We aim to analyze the efficacy and safety of TMS on cognition in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), AD-related dementias, and nondementia conditions with comorbid cognitive impairment. Design: Systematic review, Meta-Analysis Setting: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane database, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus from January 1, 2000, to February 9, 2023. Participants and interventions: RCTs, open-label, and case series studies reporting cognitive outcomes following TMS intervention were included. Measurement: Cognitive and safety outcomes were measured. Cochrane Risk of Bias for RCTs and MINORS (Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies) criteria were used to evaluate study quality. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022326423). Results: The systematic review included 143 studies (n = 5,800 participants) worldwide, encompassing 94 RCTs, 43 open-label prospective, 3 open-label retrospective, and 3 case series. The meta-analysis included 25 RCTs in MCI and AD. Collectively, these studies provide evidence of improved global and specific cognitive measures with TMS across diagnostic groups. Only 2 studies (among 143) reported 4 adverse events of seizures: 3 were deemed TMS unrelated and another resolved with coil repositioning. Meta-analysis showed large effect sizes on global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination (SMD = 0.80 [0.26, 1.33], p = 0.003), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (SMD = 0.85 [0.26, 1.44], p = 0.005), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (SMD = -0.96 [-1.32, -0.60], p < 0.001)) in MCI and AD, although with significant heterogeneity. Conclusion: The reviewed studies provide favorable evidence of improved cognition with TMS across all groups with cognitive impairment. TMS was safe and well tolerated with infrequent serious adverse events.

TI  - Motor Cortical Excitability Assessed by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Psychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review
T2  - BRAIN STIMULATION
AB  - Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a popular neurostimulation technique suitable for the investigation of inhibitory and facilitatory networks in the human motor system. In the last 20 years, several studies have used TMS to investigate cortical excitability in various psychiatric disorders, leading to a consequent improvement in pathophysiological understanding. However, little is known about the overlap and specificity of these findings across these conditions.
   Objective: To provide a systematic review of TMS studies (1985-2013) focusing on motor cortical excitability in dementia, schizophrenia, affective disorders (major depression and bipolar), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine) and other disorders (borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)).
   Methods: Systematic literature-based review.
   Results: Across disorders, patients displayed a general pattern of cortical disinhibition, while the most consistent results of reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition could be found in schizophrenia, OCD and Tourette Syndrome. In dementia, the most frequently reported finding was reduced short-latency afferent inhibition as a marker of cholinergic dysfunction.
   Conclusions: The results of this systematic review indicate a general alteration in motor cortical inhibition in mental illness, rather than disease-specific changes. Changes in motor cortical excitability provide insight that can advance understanding of the pathophysiology underlying various psychiatric disorders. Further investigations are needed to improve the diagnostic application of these parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Review of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Vascular Dementia
T2  - DEMENTIA AND GERIATRIC COGNITIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Vascular dementia (VaD) is a clinical syndrome that encompasses a wide spectrum of cognitive disorders caused by cerebrovascular disease. The subcortical ischemic form of VaD is clinically homogeneous and a major cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly. Vascular lesions contribute to cognitive decline in neurodegenerative dementias, and VaD and Alzheimer's disease often coexist and share clinical features and multiple neurotransmission involvement. These similarities have led several investigators to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to enucleate a neurophysiological profile of VaD. TMS studies have identified a pattern of cortical hyperexcitability probably related to the disruption of the integrity of white matter lesions due to cerebrovascular disease. The present review provides a perspective of these TMS techniques by further understanding the role of different neurotransmission pathways and plastic remodeling of neuronal networks in the pathogenesis of VaD.

TI  - Effect of rTMS on Parkinson's cognitive function: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BMC NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background To evaluate the effects and optimal parameters of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on cognition function of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to estimate which cognitive function may obtain more benefits from rTMS. Method The articles dealing with rTMS on cognitive function of PD patients were retrieved from the databases until April 2019. Outcomes of global cognitive function and different cognitive domains were extracted. The standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of cognitive outcome for different parameters, scales, and cognitive functions were estimated. Results Fourteen studies involving 173 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. A significant effect size was observed with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) for the global cognitive outcome based on the evidence of four published articles. Further subtests for different cognitive domains demonstrated prominent effect for the executive function. The significant effect sizes for executive function were found with multiple sessions of high-frequency rTMS over frontal cortex; especially over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). All of the other cognitive domains, which included memory, attention, and language ability, did not obtain significant effects. Conclusions Multiple sessions of high-frequency rTMS over the DLPFC may have positive effect on executive function in PD patients. Further well designed studies with large sample sizes are needed to verify our results and ascertain the long-term effects of rTMS.

TI  - Evaluation of memory performance in patients with brain disorders following rTMS treatment. A systematic review
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is being used as a non-invasive, non-pharmacological treatment with emerging clinical applications. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the possible rTMS effect on memory performance in patients suffering from central nervous system diseases.
   Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Cochrane Library were searched through April 2021 for rTMS clinical trials in neuropsychiatric conditions, assessing pre-post treatment patients' memory performance with neuropsychological measures.
   Results: One hundred and four clinical studies were included for evaluation. Overall, a large number of reports were detected with a positive outcome of patients' memory performance, concerning primarily the working memory, whereas there were also inconsistent results. In particular, considerable results were observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment and early stage Alzheimer's disease.
   Conclusions: Despite the variability of reports and the limited ability to generalize our findings, this review offers further evidence regarding the possible use of rTMS as a memory enhancement tool.
   Significance: The study provides an updated and broad review in the field and highlights the need for more adequate studies, focusing on treatment procedure characteristics, follow-up and maintenance options of this approach.

TI  - Resting and TMS-EEG markers of treatment response in major depressive disorder: A systematic review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method to identify markers of treatment response in major depressive disorder (MDD). In this review, existing literature was assessed to determine how EEG markers change with different modalities of MDD treatments, and to synthesize the breadth of EEG markers used in conjunction with MDD treatments. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from 2000 to 2021 for studies reporting resting EEG (rEEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with EEG (TMS-EEG) measures in patients undergoing MDD treatments. The search yielded 966 articles, 204 underwent full-text screening, and 51 studies were included for a narrative synthesis of findings along with confidence in the evidence. In rEEG studies, non-linear quantitative algorithms such as theta cordance and theta current density show higher predictive value than traditional linear metrics. Although less abundant, TMS-EEG measures show promise for predictive markers of brain stimulation treatment response. Future focus on TMS-EEG measures may prove fruitful, given its ability to target cortical regions of interest related to MDD.

TI  - A systematic review and meta-analysis of rTMS effects on cognitive enhancement in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
T2  - NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, has emerged as a promising treatment for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, however, the effectiveness of this therapy is unclear because of the low statistical power and heterogeneity of previous trials. The purpose of the meta-analysis was to systematically characterize the effectiveness of various combinations of rTMS parameters on different cognitive domains in patients with MCI and AD. Thirteen studies comprising 293 patients with MCI or AD were included in this analysis. Random-effects analysis revealed an overall medium-to-large effect size (0.77) favoring active rTMS over sham rTMS in the improvement of cognitive functions. Subgroup analyses revealed that (1) high-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and low-frequency rTMS at the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex significantly improved memory functions; (2) high-frequency rTMS targeting the right inferior frontal gyrus significantly enhanced executive performance; and (3) the effects of 5-30 consecutive rTMS sessions could last for 4-12 weeks. Potential mechanisms of rTMS effects on cognitive functions are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The therapeutic efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation in managing Alzheimer's disease: A systemic review and meta-analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - BackgroundRepetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is widely used to treat Alzheimer's Disease. However, the effect of rTMS is still controversial. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of rTMS on cognitive performance of AD patients. MethodsWe systematically searched relevant literatures in four major databases - PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [Central] before 28(th) April 2022. Both randomized controlled trials and cross-section studies that compared the therapeutic effect of rTMS with blank control or sham stimuli were included. ResultsA total of 14 studies involving 513 AD patients were finally included for meta-analysis. It was found that rTMS significantly improved global cognitive function (SMD = 0.24, 95%CI, 0.12 to 0.36, P = 0.0001) and daily living ability (IADL: SMD = 0.64, 95%CI, 0.21to 1.08, P = 0.004) in patients with AD, but did not show improvement in language, memory, executive ability, and mood. In further analyses, rTMS at 10 Hz, on a single target with 20 sessions of treatment was shown to produce a positive effect. In addition, improvement in cognitive functions lasted for at least 6 weeks (SMD = 0.67, 95%CI, 0.05 to 1.30,P = 0.04). ConclusionrTMS can improve the global cognition and daily living ability of AD patients. In addition, attention should be paid to the safety of rTMS in AD patients with seizures. Given the relatively small sample size, our results should be interpreted with caution.

TI  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with cognitive training is a safe and effective modality for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease: clinical experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia among the elderly. Common treatments available and non-pharmacological interventions have their limitations, and new therapeutic approaches are critically needed. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that generates an electric current-inducing modulation in cortical excitability. The previous clinical trials showed that combinations of rTMS and cognitive training (rTMS-COG), as provided by the NeuroAD medical device system, offer a novel, safe, and effective method improving mild-to-moderate AD patients. In this article, we present our experience with rTMS-COG treatment, in clinical settings, of 30 mild-to-moderate AD patients that received rTMS-COG commercial treatments in two clinics for 1-h daily sessions, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks (30 sessions). Five patients returned for a second treatment. ADAS-Cog and MMSE scores were measured pre- and post-treatments. The main analyses were conducted on patients who received 1 treatment (n = 30). Data received from the five returning patients were analyzed separately. The effect of rTMS-COG treatment was statistically significant regarding both ADAS-Cog (-2.4 point improvement, PV < 0.001) and MMSE (+1.7 points improvement, PV < 0.001) scores. About 80 % of patients gained some cognitive improvement following NeuroAD treatment, with more than 60 % improving by more than two points, for a minimum of 9 months. The Neuronix NeuroAD System was shown to be a safe and effective non-invasive modality for cognitive improvement of Alzheimer patients, with measurable outcomes lasting, in some of them, for up to 1 year, following completion of the 6-week daily intervention course (a carryover effect).

TI  - The role of noninvasive brain stimulation for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Objective This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating and comparing the efficacy of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques on the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Methods An exhaustive literature retrieval was performed on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science until October 2019. The primary outcome was the relative changes in BPSD severity scores immediately after NIBS and at the last follow-up visit. Subgroup analyses were conducted to compare the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Changes in the severity scores after NIBS were also analyzed with restriction to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Results Ten studies with 324 patients were included, out of which 7 studies involved patients with AD. The analysis results indicated that NIBS significantly improved the BPSD outcome immediately after stimulation (SMD, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10-0.52; P = 0.005), but not at the last follow-up visit (0.15; - 0.11-0.41; 0.25). Our subgroup analyses suggested that the favorable effects of rTMS remained significant at the last follow-up visit (0.57; 0.18-0.96; 0.004). This discrepancy maybe caused by the continuously insignificant outcomes of tDCS on the whole data. The results for AD patients immediately after stimulation (0.37; 0.12-0.61; 0.003) and at the last follow-up visit (0.29; - 0.19-0.76; 0.24) were both largely similar to those in the whole patient group with dementia. Conclusions rTMS, rather than tDCS, was capable of persistently improving the BPSD at an early stage after treatment. More trials are warranted to confirm our results before the establishment of final conclusions.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation effects on cognitive enhancement in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - IntroductionTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive intervention that holds promise for improving cognitive function in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effectiveness of this therapy and the optimal TMS parameters has not reached a consensus. The purpose of the meta-analysis was to systematically discern the effectiveness of different components of TMS protocols on cognitive improvement in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.MethodsThe meta-analysis was preregistered on Prospero (registration number: CRD42022345482). PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library databases were used to search, screen and identify eligible studies with the following keywords: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation OR TMS OR theta burst stimulation AND Alzheimer OR Alzheimers OR Alzheimer's OR mild cognitive impairment OR MCI. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with accepted standardized diagnostic criteria were searched by two authors independently. The risk of bias was assessed using an adapted Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the influential factors.ResultsA total of 21 studies and 25 trials were included in this meta-analysis. The findings revealed a significant overall cognition improvement of real stimulation compared with sham stimulation (short-term effects: SMD, 0.91; 95% CI 0.44-1.38; P < 0.01; long-lasting effects: SMD, 0.91; 95% CI 0.27-1.55; P < 0.01). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral cerebellums, as well as moderate frequency stimulation (5 Hz and 10 Hz) on mild and moderate cognitive impairment patients, were more effective than other TMS protocols. However, the additional application of cognitive training showed no significant improvement.ConclusionCognitive improvement effect of TMS was demonstrated in MCI and AD patients in both short-term assessment and long-lasting outcomes, and the efficiency of TMS is affected by the stimulation frequency, stimulation site, and participant characteristics. Further RCTs are needed to validate the findings of our subgroup analysis.

TI  - Gamma-induction in frontotemporal dementia (GIFTeD) randomized placebo-controlled trial: Rationale, noninvasive brain stimulation protocol, and study design
T2  - ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA-TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH & CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS
AB  - Introduction Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder for which there is no effective pharmacological treatment. Recently, interneuron activity responsible for fast oscillatory brain activity has been found to be impaired in a mouse model of FTD with consequent cognitive and behavioral alterations. In this study, we aim to investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a novel promising therapeutic intervention for FTD based on 40 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation thought to engage neural activity in a frequency-specific manner and thus suited to restore altered brain oscillatory patterns. Methods This is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on 50 patients with a diagnosis of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD). Participants will be randomized to undergo either 30 days of 1-hour daily tACS or Sham (placebo) tACS. The outcomes will be assessed at baseline, right after the intervention and at a 3- to 6-months follow-up. The primary outcome measures are represented by the safety and feasibility of tACS administration, which will be assessed considering the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events as well as attrition rate, respectively. To assess secondary outcomes, participants will undergo extensive neuropsychological and behavioral assessments and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans to evaluate changes in brain metabolism, functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting and evoked electroencephalography, as well as blood biomarkers to measure changes in neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory markers. Results The trial started in October 2020 and will end in October 2023. Study protocols have been approved by the local institutional review board (IRB) at each data-collection site. Discussion This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of 40 Hz tACS in bvFTD patients and its efficacy on gamma oscillatory activity, cognitive function, and brain glucose hypometabolism.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Rodent Models
T2  - CNS & NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS-DRUG TARGETS
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method that can be used as an interventional technique to investigate causality in the brain-behavior relationship, through depolarization or hyperpolarization in the neurons of the brain. Different techniques of TMS can be used to investigate causality in the brain-behavior relationship. The behavioral effects induced by TMS are complex since it has been shown that the performance in the same cognitive task can be either facilitated or inhibited depending on the area being stimulated. To date, most studies involving TMS are focused mainly on the facilitation properties of this technique. It is used to treat a wide-range of neurological and psychiatric conditions such as depression, ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, or motor impairment. Interestingly, TMS can be used to induce a virtual lesion that could provide a valuable and much needed model of cognitive impairments in early preclinical development. This review describes the existing TMS paradigms in rodents and the major challenges that were encountered by the researchers as the method was translated from clinical to preclinical applications. In summary, the existing knowledge gained in animal research emphasizes the necessity to investigate new TMS paradigms in the preclinical setting and its effects.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)/repetitive TMS in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
T2  - ACTA NEUROLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
AB  - Several Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) techniques can be applied to noninvasively measure cortical excitability and brain plasticity in humans. TMS has been used to assess neuroplastic changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), corroborating findings that cortical physiology is altered in AD due to the underlying neurodegenerative process. In fact, many TMS studies have provided physiological evidence of abnormalities in cortical excitability, connectivity, and plasticity in patients with AD. Moreover, the combination of TMS with other neurophysiological techniques, such as high-density electroencephalography (EEG), makes it possible to study local and network cortical plasticity directly. Interestingly, several TMS studies revealed abnormalities in patients with early AD and even with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), thus enabling early identification of subjects in whom the cholinergic degeneration has occurred. Furthermore, TMS can influence brain function if delivered repetitively; repetitive TMS (rTMS) is capable of modulating cortical excitability and inducing long-lasting neuroplastic changes. Preliminary findings have suggested that rTMS can enhance performances on several cognitive functions impaired in AD and MCI. However, further well-controlled studies with appropriate methodology in larger patient cohorts are needed to replicate and extend the initial findings. The purpose of this paper was to provide an updated and comprehensive systematic review of the studies that have employed TMS/rTMS in patients with MCI and AD.

TI  - Sleep-wake, cognitive and clinical correlates of treatment outcome with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for young adults with depression
T2  - PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
AB  - The utility of key phenotypes of depression in predicting response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), namely sleep-wake behaviour, cognition and illness chronicity, has been understudied and not been extended to young samples. This study aimed to determine whether sleep-wake disturbance, cognition or depression chronicity are associated with rTMS outcome in young depressed adults. Sixteen depressed young adults diagnosed with mood disorders (aged 18-29 years) completed this open-label study. Neuronavigationally targeted high-frequency rTMS was administered at 110% of motor threshold on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 20 sessions over 4 weeks. Clinical, sleep-wake and cognitive assessments were undertaken pre- and post-treatment. Repeated-measures and correlational analyses determined pre- and post-treatment changes and predictors of treatment outcome. rTMS significantly reduced depression and anxiety. Better cognitive flexibility, verbal learning, later age of onset and greater number of depressive episodes were associated with better treatment outcome. There were no other significant/trend-level associations. rTMS had no effect on sleep-wake or cognitive measures. We provide the first evidence for the utility of cognitive flexibility and verbal learning in predicting rTMS outcome in depressed young adults. This research provides preliminary support for rTMS as an early intervention for depression and supports the need for sham-controlled trials.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of neuromodulation for apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Non-pharmacological interventions, including noninvasive neuromodulation, may alleviate apathy in individuals with Alzheimer's disease. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of neuromodulation for apathy in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of neuromodulation for apathy in AD or MCI. The primary outcome was change in apathy based on the Apathy Evaluation Scale. Secondary outcomes were change in global cognition and trial discontinuation. Results: The meta-analysis included four RCTs involving 89 patients (aged 65.6-80.5 years) with apathy in AD or MCI. Findings showed no significant improvement in apathy (SMD = 0.57, 95% CI = - 0.22-1.36; P = 0.16) or global cognition (SMD = 0.83, 95% CI = -0.11-1.78; P = 0.08) with neuromodulation compared to sham. Subgroup analyses showed significant improvement in apathy with high-frequency rTMS at 120% RMT compared to sham (SMD = 1.36, [95% CI = 0.61-2.12]; P = 0.0004), but not with rTMS at 80% RMT. For global cognition, high-frequency rTMS resulted in significant enhancement (SMD = 1.34 [95% CI = 0.59-2.10]; P = 0.0005), but no notable difference was observed with tDCS compared to sham. There was no significant difference in trial discontinuation in patients with AD or MCI treated with neuromodulation compared to sham. Conclusion: High-frequency rTMS at 120% RMT for four weeks may be efficacious and safe for the treatment of apathy in elderly patients with AD or MCI. High-frequency rTMS may also improve global cognition in these patients. This implies rTMS has potential as an intervention for apathy in AD and MCI. Large well conducted RCTs are warranted to explore this effect further.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for the Assessment of Neurodegenerative Disease
T2  - NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive technique that has provided important information about cortical function across an array of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and related extrapyramidal disorders. Application of TMS techniques in neurodegenerative diseases has provided important pathophysiological insights, leading to the development of pathogenic and diagnostic biomarkers that could be used in the clinical setting and therapeutic trials. Abnormalities of TMS outcome measures heralding cortical hyperexcitability, as evidenced by a reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition and increased in motor-evoked potential amplitude, have been consistently identified as early and intrinsic features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), preceding and correlating with the ensuing neurodegeneration. Cortical hyperexcitability appears to form the pathogenic basis of ALS, mediated by trans-synaptic glutamate-mediated excitotoxic mechanisms. As a consequence of these research findings, TMS has been developed as a potential diagnostic biomarker, capable of identifying upper motor neuronal pathology, at earlier stages of the disease process, and thereby aiding in ALS diagnosis. Of further relevance, marked TMS abnormalities have been reported in other neurodegenerative diseases, which have varied from findings in ALS. With time and greater utilization by clinicians, TMS outcome measures may prove to be of utility in future therapeutic trial settings across the neurodegenerative disease spectrum, including the monitoring of neuroprotective, stem-cell, and genetic-based strategies, thereby enabling assessment of biological effectiveness at early stages of drug development.

TI  - Effect of transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation on the cognitive function of individuals with Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - ObjectiveTo analyze the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the cognitive function of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD).MethodsThis systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression included randomized clinical trials published until 05/2022. We included studies conducted with individuals with AD of both sexes, aged between 55 and 85 years, treated with tDCS, TMS, or both.ResultsTwenty-one studies were included in the systematic review and sixteen in the meta-analysis. Meta-regression suggested a significant influence of anodic tDCS with current intensity of 1.5 mA on cognitive function. Significant results were found with treatment frequencies of three and five days a week for two weeks. Subgroup analysis found that anodic tDCS influences cognitive function, regardless of AD stage. Similar was observed for TMS using a frequency of 20 Hz and current intensity of 90% of the resting motor threshold.DiscussionAnodal tDCS and 20 Hz TMS have demonstrated the ability to improve cognitive function in AD by modulating neural activity. These therapies are safe and well-tolerated, offering promise as adjuncts to available pharmacological treatments. Studies with greater methodological rigor and parameter standardization are warranted. Comprehensive investigations involving neuroimaging techniques may provide a better understanding of the interaction between induced electrical fields and the complex neural networks affected in AD, paving the way for more personalized and effective neurostimulation approaches

TI  - Effects of bilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on prospective memory in patients with schizophrenia: A double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - AimsTo investigate effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on the prospective memory (PM) in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ).MethodsFifty of 71 patients completed this double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial and compared with 18 healthy controls' (HCs) PM outcomes. Bilateral 20 Hz rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 90% RMT administered 5 weekdays for 4 weeks for a total of 20 treatments. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), and PM test were assessed before and after treatment.ResultsBoth Event-based PM (EBPM) and Time-based PM (TBPM) scores at baseline were significantly lower in patients with SCZ than that in HCs. After rTMS treatments, the scores of EBPM in patients with SCZ was significantly improved and had no differences from that in HCs, while the scores of TBPM did not improved. The negative symptom scores on PANSS and the scores of almost all subscales and total scores of SANS were significantly improved in both groups.ConclusionsOur findings indicated that bilateral high-frequency rTMS treatment can alleviate EBPM but not TBPM in patients with SCZ, as well as improve the negative symptoms. Significance: Our results provide one therapeutic option for PM in patients with SCZ.
   This is the first study to investigate the effect of long-term rTMS on PM impairment in patients with schizophrenia. We observed a positive result with active rTMS on EBPM, but not on TBPM, compared to sham stimulation. Our results provide one therapeutic option for PM in patients with SCZ.image

TI  - A comprehensive review of transcranial magnetic stimulation in secondary dementia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Although primary degenerative diseases are the main cause of dementia, a non-negligible proportion of patients is affected by a secondary and potentially treatable cognitive disorder. Therefore, diagnostic tools able to early identify and monitor them and to predict the response to treatment are needed. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neurophysiological technique capable of evaluating in vivo and in "real time" the motor areas, the cortico-spinal tract, and the neurotransmission pathways in several neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including cognitive impairment and dementia. While consistent evidence has been accumulated for Alzheimer's disease, other degenerative cognitive disorders, and vascular dementia, to date a comprehensive review of TMS studies available in other secondary dementias is lacking. These conditions include, among others, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, multiple sclerosis, celiac disease and other immunologically mediated diseases, as well as a number of inflammatory, infective, metabolic, toxic, nutritional, endocrine, sleep-related, and rare genetic disorders. Overall, we observed that, while in degenerative dementia neurophysiological alterations might mirror specific, and possibly primary, neuropathological changes (and hence be used as early biomarkers), this pathogenic link appears to be weaker for most secondary forms of dementia, in which neurotransmitter dysfunction is more likely related to a systemic or diffuse neural damage. In these cases, therefore, an effort toward the understanding of pathological mechanisms of cognitive impairment should be made, also by investigating the relationship between functional alterations of brain circuits and the specific mechanisms of neuronal damage triggered by the causative disease. Neurophysiologically, although no distinctive TMS pattern can be identified that might be used to predict the occurrence or progression of cognitive decline in a specific condition, some TMS-associated measures of cortical function and plasticity (such as the short-latency afferent inhibition, the short-interval intracortical inhibition, and the cortical silent period) might add useful information in most of secondary dementia, especially in combination with suggestive clinical features and other diagnostic tests. The possibility to detect dysfunctional cortical circuits, to monitor the disease course, to probe the response to treatment, and to design novel neuromodulatory interventions in secondary dementia still represents a gap in the literature that needs to be explored.

TI  - High-frequency rTMS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for post-stroke depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: This meta-analysis investigated the therapeutic efficacy of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for treatment of post-stroke depression (PSD).Methods: Ten articles with 266 patients in rTMS group and 258 patients in control group were included. The primary outcome was performed to examine the efficacy of rTMS for PSD. Secondary outcomes of response rates and remission rates and subgroup analyses were further explored.Results: Our meta-analysis revealed a significant pooled effect size (the standard mean difference (SMD) was -1.45 points (95% CI, -2.04 to -0.86; p < 0.00001)). The odds ratio (OR) of the response rate and remission rate were 8.41 (95% CI, 2.52-28.12, p = 0.0005) and 6.04 (95% CI, 1.5-24.39, p = 0.01). Moreover, rTMS treatment for PSD patients in subacute phase and targeting the left DLPFC at 5-cm anterior to the left motor hotspot or the midpoint of the middle frontal gyrus showed significant antidepressant effect. In addition, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was sensitive to detect depressive changes in patients.Conclusions: Our meta-analysis elucidated that the application of high-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC was an effective treatment alternative for PSD. Significance: Our meta-analysis may help to develop more reasonable treatment strategies in clinical practice for PSD patients.(c) 2023 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in treatment of psychiatric disorders - review of current studies
T2  - PSYCHIATRIA POLSKA
AB  - Current progress of basic and clinical science creates background for new therapeutic appliances of brain stimulation methods in disorders of central nervous system. This review describes present state of knowledge regarding practical aspects of one of those methods transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS. The review was based on contemporary literature on use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in various diseases, particularly including present recommendations and guidelines as well as systematic reviews, published after year 2000.
   TMS is a quite novel, non-invasive, well tolerated treatment method with a low amount of transient adverse effects and complications. Development of new therapeutic protocols makes it possible to introduce this procedure in new groups of patients, including a wide range of mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, also cognitive function disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder. In Poland it is still hardly available, though more and more clinical centers start to perform this kind of therapy, providing proper equipment and trained personnel.

TI  - Cortical excitability and plasticity in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis of transcranial magnetic stimulation studies
T2  - AGEING RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB  - Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique. When stimulation is applied over the primary motor cortex and coupled with electromyography measures, TMS can probe functions of cortical excitability and plasticity in vivo. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the utility of TMS-derived measures for differentiating patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from cognitively normal older adults (CN).Methods: Databases searched included PubMed, Embase, APA PsycInfo, Medline, and CINAHL Plus from inception to July 2021. Results: Sixty-one studies with a total of 2728 participants (1454 patients with AD, 163 patients with MCI, and 1111 CN) were included. Patients with AD showed significantly higher cortical excitability, lower cortical inhibition, and impaired cortical plasticity compared to the CN cohorts. Patients with MCI exhibited increased cortical excitability and reduced plasticity compared to the CN cohort. Additionally, lower cognitive performance was significantly associated with higher cortical excitability and lower inhibition. No seizure events due to TMS were reported, and the mild adverse response rate is approximately 3/1000 (i.e., 9/2728).Conclusions: Findings of our meta-analysis demonstrate the potential of using TMS-derived cortical excitability and plasticity measures as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD and MCI.

TI  - Efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation on global cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis and systematic review
T2  - AGEING RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB  - Background: Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have shown some promise in improving cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, data from clinical trials involving NIBS have shown inconsistent results. This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of NIBS, specifically repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) compared to sham stimulation on global cognition and NPS in people with AD and MCI. Method: Multi-session randomized sham-controlled clinical trials were identified through MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase until June 2021. Standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the active and sham treatments were calculated using random-effects meta-analyses. Included studies reported outcome measures for global cognition and/or NPS. Heterogeneity, from different NIBS techniques, disease populations, or tests used to assess global cognition or NPS, was measured using chi-square and I2, and investigated using subgroup analyses. Possible effects of covariates were also investigated using meta-regressions. Result: The pooled meta-analyses included 19 studies measuring global cognition (Nactive=288, Nsham=264), and 9 studies investigating NPS (Nactive=165, Nsham=140). NIBS significantly improved global cognition (SMD=1.14; 95% CI=0.49,1.78; p = 0.001; I2 = 90.2%) and NPS (SMD=0.82; 95% CI=0.13, 1.50; p = 0.019; I2 = 86.1%) relative to sham stimulation in patients with AD and MCI. Subgroup analyses found these effects were restricted to rTMS but not tDCS, and to patients with AD but not MCI. Meta-regression showed that age was significantly associated with global cognition response (Nstudies=16, p = 0.020, I2 = 89.51%, R2 = 28.96%), with larger effects sizes in younger populations. All significant meta-analyses had large effect sizes (SMD >= 0.8), suggesting clinical utility of NIBS in the short term. There remained substantial heterogeneity across all subgroup analyses and meta-regressions (all I2 > 50%). Egger's tests showed no evidence of publication biases. Conclusion: rTMS improved global cognition and NPS in those with AD. Further studies in MCI and using tDCS will help to fully evaluate the specific NIBS techniques and populations most likely to benefit on global cognition and NPS measures. Additional research should investigate the long term clinical utility of NIBS in these populations.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in the Treatment of Neurological Diseases
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has widespread use in research and clinical application. For psychiatric applications, such as depression or OCD, repetitive TMS protocols (rTMS) are an established and globally applied treatment option. While promising, rTMS is not yet as common in treating neurological diseases, except for neurorehabilitation after (motor) stroke and neuropathic pain treatment. This may soon change. New clinical studies testing the potential of rTMS in various other neurological conditions appear at a rapid pace. This can prove challenging for both practitioners and clinical researchers. Although most of these neurological applications have not yet received the same level of scientific/empirical scrutiny as motor stroke and neuropathic pain, the results are encouraging, opening new doors for TMS in neurology. We here review the latest clinical evidence for rTMS in pioneering neurological applications including movement disorders, Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and disorders of consciousness.

TI  - Neurophysiological biomarkers using transcranial magnetic stimulation in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neurophysiological tool that enables the investigation of cortical excitability in the human brain. Paired-pulse TMS paradigms include shortand long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI/LICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which can assess neurophysiological functions of GABAergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic neural circuits, respectively. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to compare these TMS indices among patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HC). Our meta-analyses indicated that RMT, SAI, SICI, and LICI were significantly lower in patients with AD, while ICF did not show a difference in patients with AD compared with HC. In patients with MCI, RMT and SAI were significantly lower than in HC. In conclusion, motor cortical excitability was increased, while cholinergic function was decreased in AD and MCI in comparison with HC and patients with AD had decreased GABAergic and glutamatergic functions compared with HC. Our results warrant further studies to differentiate AD, MCI, and HC, employing multimodal TMS neurophysiology.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in the Elderly
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHIATRY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review This article aims to review select applications of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) that have significant relevance in geriatric psychiatry.
   Recent Findings Small study sizes and parameter variability limit the generalizability of many TMS studies in geriatric patients. Additionally, geriatric patients have unique characteristics that can moderate the efficacy of TMS. Nonetheless, several promising experimental applications in addition to the FDA-approved indication for major depression have emerged. Cognitive impairment, neuropathic pain, and smoking cessation are experimental applications with special significance to the elderly. Cognitive impairment has been researched the most in this population and evidence thus far suggests that TMS has potential therapeutic benefit. There is also evidence to suggest benefit from TMS for neuropathic pain and smoking cessation in working age adults. TMS is consistently reported as a safe and well-tolerated treatment modality with no adverse cognitive side effects.
   Summary TMS is a safe treatment modality that can be effective for certain applications in the elderly. Additional research that specifically includes older subjects is needed to replicate findings and to optimize treatment protocols for this population.

TI  - Related noise exposure and auditory consequence during transcranial magnetic stimulation: New insights and review of the literature
T2  - NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neurostimulaton tool with increasing therapeutic applications in neurology, psychiatry and in the treatment of chronic tinnitus, and with a growing interest in cognitive neuroscience. One of its side effects is the loud click sound generated simultaneously to the magnetic pulse, which depends both on the equipment and rTMS intensity. This impulse sound could transiently modify peripheral hearing mechanisms, and hence hearing thresholds, both in patients and in rTMS practitioners. Furthermore, if no precautions are taken, especially in subjects with several risks factors for hearing loss, it is possible that the repetition of exposure could lead to more definitive changes in hearing thresholds. These issues are often neglected, although they could have specific relevance in rTMS treatment for tinnitus or in auditory cognitive neuroscience. This review specifically deals with noise exposure during rTMS and its potential consequences on the auditory system. It provides several practical solutions to help minimize exposure.

TI  - Frontotemporal Dementia, Where Do We Stand? A Narrative Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disease of growing interest, since it accounts for up to 10% of middle-age-onset dementias and entails a social, economic, and emotional burden for the patients and caregivers. It is characterised by a (at least initially) selective degeneration of the frontal and/or temporal lobe, generally leading to behavioural alterations, speech disorders, and psychiatric symptoms. Despite the recent advances, given its extreme heterogeneity, an overview that can bring together all the data currently available is still lacking. Here, we aim to provide a state of the art on the pathogenesis of this disease, starting with established findings and integrating them with more recent ones. In particular, advances in the genetics field will be examined, assessing them in relation to both the clinical manifestations and histopathological findings, as well as considering the link with other diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Furthermore, the current diagnostic criteria will be explored, including neuroimaging methods, nuclear medicine investigations, and biomarkers on biological fluids. Of note, the promising information provided by neurophysiological investigations, i.e., electroencephalography and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, concerning the alterations in brain networks and neurotransmitter systems will be reviewed. Finally, current and experimental therapies will be considered.

TI  - High-Frequency rTMS Could Improve Impaired Memory in Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients in China <i>A Randomized Controlled Study</i>
T2  - ALZHEIMER DISEASE & ASSOCIATED DISORDERS
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on improving memory deficits in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as well as to provide visualized evidence for neuronal specificity by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Materials and Methods: Forty MCI patients were enrolled to receive 10-session and sham-controlled 10Hz-rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with memory scales assessment were performed before and after the intervention. To elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of rTMS, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and functional connectivity were calculated. The Pearson correlation was used to measure the relationship between ALFF and memory performance.
   Results: Compared with the sham group, ALFF significantly increased in the right insula, right inferior frontal gyrus-opercular part, and decreased in the left middle occipital gyrus, left angular gyrus, and left lingual gyrus after rTMS. The change in Auditory Verbal Learning Test scores were negatively correlated with ALFF decreases in the left lingual gyrus. Functional connectivity significantly increased between the posterior cingulate cortex and right supramarginal gyrus, and decreased between the right frontoinsular cortex and right supramarginal gyrus after intervention.
   Conclusion: High-frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could facilitate improvement on impaired memory in patients with MCI via modulating the neuronal activity and brain network.

TI  - The contribution of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the diagnosis and in the management of dementia
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is emerging as a promising tool to non-invasively assess specific cortical circuits in neurological diseases. A number of studies have reported the abnormalities in TMS assays of cortical function in dementias. A PubMed-based literature review on TMS studies targeting primary and secondary dementia has been conducted using the key words "transcranial magnetic stimulation'' or "motor cortex excitability'' and "dementia'' or "cognitive impairment'' or "memory impairment'' or "memory decline''. Cortical excitability is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in vascular dementia (VaD), generally reduced in secondary dementias. Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), a measure of central cholinergic circuitry, is normal in VaD and in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but suppressed in AD. In mild cognitive impairment, abnormal SAI may predict the progression to AD. No change in cortical excitability has been observed in FTD, in Parkinson's dementia and in dementia with Lewy bodies. Short-interval intracortical inhibition and controlateral silent period (cSP), two measures of gabaergic cortical inhibition, are abnormal in most dementias associated with parkinsonian symptoms. Ipsilateral silent period (iSP), which is dependent on integrity of the corpus callosum is abnormal in AD. While single TMS measure owns low specificity, a panel of measures can support the clinical diagnosis, predict progression and possibly identify earlier the "brain at risk''. In dementias, TMS can be also exploited to select and evaluate the responders to specific drugs and, it might become a rehabilitative tool, in the attempt to restore impaired brain plasticity.

TI  - Advances in the treatment and management of frontotemporal dementia
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - IntroductionFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by a wide range of pathological conditions associated with the buildup of proteins such as tau and TDP-43. With a strong hereditary component, FTD often results from genetic variants in three genes - MAPT, GRN, and C9orf72.Areas coveredIn this review, the authors explore abnormal protein accumulation in FTD and forthcoming treatments, providing a detailed analysis of new diagnostic advancements, including innovative markers. They analyze how these discoveries have influenced therapeutic strategies, particularly disease-modifying treatments, which could potentially transform FTD management. This comprehensive exploration of FTD from its molecular underpinnings to its therapeutic prospects offers a compelling overview of the current state of FTD research.Expert opinionNotable challenges in FTD management involve identifying reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and response monitoring. Genetic forms of FTD, particularly those linked to C9orf72 and GRN, show promise, with targeted therapies resulting in substantial progress in disease-modifying strategies. The potential of neuromodulation techniques, like tDCS and rTMS, is being explored, requiring further study. Ongoing trials and multi-disciplinary care highlight the continued push toward effective FTD treatments. With increasing understanding of FTD's molecular and clinical intricacies, the hope for developing effective interventions grows.

TI  - Effects of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation on Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - JPAD-JOURNAL OF PREVENTION OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Background Previous meta-analyses did not explore the immediate and long-term effect of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) on different cognitive domains in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The meta-analysis aimed to assess the therapy effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on different cognitive domains in AD in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods Studies published before December 2021 and exploring therapy effect of rTMS, tDCS on different cognitive domains in AD were searched in the following databases: PubMed and Web of Science. We used STATA 12.0 software to compute the standard mean difference (SMD) and a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results The present study included 16 articles (including 372 AD patients treated with rTMS and 310 treated with sham rTMS) for rTMS and 11 articles (including 152 AD patients treated with tDCS and 134 treated with sham tDCS) for tDCS. The present study showed better immediate and long-term general cognitive function increase effects in AD given rTMS, compared to those given sham rTMS with random effects models (immediate effect: SMD = 2.07, 95% CI = 0.37 to 3.77, I2 = 97.8%, p < 0.001; long-term effect: SMD = 5.04, 95% CI = 2.25 to 7.84, I2 = 97.8%, p < 0.001). The present study showed no significant immediate and long-term effects of rTMS on attention, executive, language and memory functions. In addition, the present study showed no significant difference in immediate or long-term effects of tDCS on general cognitive function, attention, language or memory functions between tDCS group and sham tDCS group. Conclusions RTMS was an effective treatment technique for general cognitive function in AD, whereas tDCS showed no significant therapy effect on cognitive function in AD. More large-scale studies were essential to explore the effect of NIBS on various cognitive function in AD.

TI  - Non-invasive brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease: Exploiting crossroads of cognition and mood
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Cognitive impairments and depression are common non-motor manifestations in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent evidence suggests that both partially arise via the same frontostriatal network, opening the opportunity for concomitant treatment with non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).
   In this systematic review, we evaluate the effects of NIBS on cognition and/or mood in 19 placebo controlled studies involving 561 PD patients. Outcomes depended on the area stimulated and the technique used. rTMS over the dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) resulted in significant reductions in scores of depressive symptoms with moderate to large effect sizes along with increased performance in several tests of cognitive functions. tDCS over the DLPFC improved performance in several cognitive measures, including executive functions with large effect sizes. Additional effects of tDCS on mood were not detectable; however, only non-depressed patients were assessed. Further confirmatory research is needed to clarify the contribution that NIBS could make in the care of PD patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparisons between traditional medicines and pharmacotherapies for Alzheimer disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive outcomes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate the clinical evidence for traditional medicines (TMs) used in East Asia on measures of cognition in Alzheimer disease, determine the effect sizes at different time points for the TMs and pharmacotherapies, and assess the tolerability of the TMs.
   MethodsWe searched 12 databases in English, Chinese, and Japanese for eligible randomised controlled trials that compared orally administered TMs with pharmacotherapy and reported cognitive outcomes. Meta-analyses were conducted for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale and/or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate treatment effects.
   ResultsThirty randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine compared TMs with donepezil. Single studies provided comparisons with galantamine, rivastigmine, or memantine. There were no significant differences between the TM and donepezil groups at 12 or 24weeks for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale or MMSE. Improvements over baseline were significant for MMSE at 12 and 24weeks within the TM and donepezil groups and remained significant at 1year. Effect sizes were reduced in the 3 double-blind studies. At 24weeks, donepezil 10mg/d generally produced greater improvements in MMSE than 5mg/d. Tolerability reporting was incomplete and inconsistent between studies.
   ConclusionsThe results suggested that the clinical benefits of the TMs were not less than donepezil at comparable time points, with both groups showing improvements. However, lack of blinding in most studies and other design and measurement issues are likely to have resulted in overestimation of effect sizes in both groups. Further well-designed studies are needed.

TI  - Benefits of Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Alzheimer Disease <i>Case Series</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECT
AB  - Background: Patients diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (AD) show severe cognitive deficits. Decline in memory, language, and executive function have repeatedly been reported. Although AD affects 60% to 80% of demented elderly patients, there is currently no cure and limited treatment alternatives.
   Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of stimulating prefrontal cortex (PFC) with deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) to ameliorate cognitive deficits in patients suffering from AD.
   Methods: Eleven patients (6 males; mean [SD] age, 76 [7] years) in moderate to severe stages of AD received dTMS over the PFC for 20 sessions. Computerized battery (Mindstreams [MS]) and neuropsychological testing (Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination [ACE]) were used to assess cognitive performance before and after treatment.
   Results: Compared with baseline, 60% of patients performed better on the MS battery and 77% of patients performed better on the ACE testing at the end of dTMS treatment. None of the patients performed worse on both tests at the end of treatment. The DTMS effects on the group mean in ACE and MS approached significance (P = 0.065 and P = 0.086, respectively). A dTMS-induced improvement in the ACE was significant (P = 0.001) on patients in more progressed stage (n = 6). Change in ACE negatively correlated with score at baseline.
   Conclusions: In sum, the current report of this novel technique indicates that deep stimulation might lead to preservation and even improvement of cognitive functions, at least during the time of treatment. Further examinations should report of long-term effects of this technique.

TI  - Efficacy of scalp stimulation for multidomain cognitive impairment in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia: A network meta-analysis and meta-regression of moderators
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE BASED MEDICINE
AB  - BackgroundScalp stimulation has gained more traction for post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID); the interaction between stimulation targets and parameters influences the response to the stimulation. However, the most efficacious treatment for improving different domains of cognitive impairment remains unknown.ObjectiveWe aimed to conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the efficacy of various scalp stimulation protocols used in PSCID treatment.MethodsRandomized controlled trials of scalp stimulation in patients with PSCID were searched in eight databases over the past 20 years. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) for global and subdomain cognitive scores were pooled in Bayesian NMA. Moderators were examined using meta-regression analysis.ResultsA total of 90 trials, with 6199 patients, were included. Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the unaffected dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was highly suggested for alleviating global severity (SMD = 1.11, 95% CI (0.64, 1.57)). High-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC was recommended for language use (1.85 (1.18, 2.52)), executive function (0.85 (0.36, 1.33)), orientation deficits (0.59 (0.07, 1.13)), and attention (0.85 (0.27, 1.43)). Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the affected DLPFC (2.03 (0.72, 3.34)) was recommended for treating memory impairment. Meta-regression analyses showed significant associations within attention, language and orientation.ConclusionOverall, different cognitive domains have different optimal scalp stimulation prescriptions, and activating the affected key brain regions and inhibiting the unaffected area is still the most effective treatment.

TI  - Biological, Neuroimaging, and Neurophysiological Markers in Frontotemporal Dementia: Three Faces of the Same Coin
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous clinical, genetic, and neuropathological disorder. Clinical diagnosis and prediction of neuropathological substrates are hampered by heterogeneous pictures. Diagnostic markers are key in clinical trials to differentiate FTD from other neurodegenerative dementias. In the same view, identifying the neuropathological hallmarks of the disease is key in light of future disease-modifying treatments. The aim of the present review is to unravel the progress in biomarker discovery, discussing the potential applications of available biological, imaging, and neurophysiological markers.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on the Precuneus in Alzheimer's Disease: A Literature Review
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - The current literature review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of rTMS on the precuneus as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the number of studies specifically targeting the precuneus is limited, the results from this review suggest the potential benefits of this approach. Future studies should focus on exploring the long-term effects of rTMS on the precuneus in Alzheimer's disease patients, as well as determining the optimal stimulation parameters and protocols for this population. Additionally, investigating the effects of rTMS on the precuneus in combination with other brain regions implicated in AD may provide valuable insights into the development of effective treatment for this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.

TI  - Exploring the potential of combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography to investigate mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review
T2  - GEROSCIENCE
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) are non-invasive techniques used for neuromodulation and recording brain electrical activity, respectively. The integration of TMS-EEG has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating the complex mechanisms involved in age-related disorders, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). By systematically synthesizing TMS-EEG studies, this review aims to shed light on the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying MCI and AD, while also exploring the practical applications of TMS-EEG in clinical settings. PubMed, ScienceDirect, and PsychInfo were selected as the databases for this review. The 22 eligible studies included a total of 592 individuals with MCI or AD as well as 301 cognitively normal adults. TMS-EEG assessments unveiled specific patterns of corticospinal excitability, plasticity, and brain connectivity that distinguished individuals on the AD spectrum from cognitively normal older adults. Moreover, the TMS-induced EEG features were observed to be correlated with cognitive performance and the presence of AD pathological biomarkers. The comprehensive examination of the existing studies demonstrates that the combination of TMS and EEG has yielded valuable insights into the neurophysiology of MCI and AD. This integration shows great potential for early detection, monitoring disease progression, and anticipating response to treatment. Future research is of paramount importance to delve into the potential utilization of TMS-EEG for treatment optimization in individuals with MCI and AD.

TI  - The Combination of rTMS and Pharmacotherapy on <i>In Vitro</i> Models: A Mini-Review
T2  - CNS & NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS-DRUG TARGETS
AB  - Background: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that is being actively explored as a potential therapeutic modality in various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and neuro-degenerative disorders, including the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The Food and Drug Ad-ministration (FDA) approved rTMS for the treatment of major depression, migraine-associated head-aches, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The fact that a significant proportion of patients suffering from these disorders fail to respond to current pharmacological interventions indicates the need for alternative therapies like rTMS.
   Objective: The objective was to find and summarize all studies combining the use of rTMS and pharmacological interference in vitro, in order to facilitate future studies.
   Methods: The results of studies combining the use of rTMS with pharmacological interference in vitro were focused on. The PubMed database was searched using the terms "rTMS", "repetitive", "transcranial", "magnetic", "stimulation", "in vitro", "in vivo", "cell cultures" untilMarch 2019 and 7 eligible studies were found.
   Results: Overall results show a synergistic effect of rTMS and pharmacotherapy in vitro with additive effectiveness, better prognosis, and superior potential management.
   Conclusion: The limited amount of knowledge denotes the need for additional in vitro studies on the combination of rTMS and pharmacotherapy, which could be extended to in vivo studies and ultimately help design clinical trials so as to improve the therapeutic management of patients with a wide array of neuropsychiatric disorders.

TI  - Efficacy analysis of three brain stimulation techniques for Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and deep brain stimulation
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Introduction: This systematic review and meta-analysis study investigates the efficacy of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS) using neuropsychological assessments as a potential treatment option for Alzheimer's disease (AD).Methods: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies on rTMS, tDCS, and DBS for the treatment of patients with AD between April 1970 and October 2022. The mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and AD Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) were adopted as the efficacy index.Results: The analysis yielded 17 eligible studies. rTMS greatly improved the cognition of patients with AD (immediate post-treatment WMD of MMSE score: 2.06, p < 0.00001; short-term follow-up WMD of MMSE score: 2.12, p = 0.006; WMD of ADAS-Cog score in single-arm studies: -4.97, p = 0.001). DBS did not reverse the progression of cognitive decline (WMD of ADAS-Cog score in single-arm studies: 7.40, p < 0.00001). Furthermore, tDCS demonstrated no significant efficacy in improving cognition in random clinical trials or single-arm studies.Conclusion: rTMS is a promising non-medicinal alternative for cognitive improvement inpatients with AD.

TI  - The Effect of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) on Attention and Memory Function in Stroke Rehabilitation Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - Background: In recent years, the potential of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) for therapeutic effects on cognitive functions has been explored for populations with stroke. There are various NIBS methods depending on the stimulation site and stimulation parameters. However, there is no systematic NIBS review of post-stroke cognitive impairment with a focus on stimulation sites and stimulation parameters. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on effectiveness and safety of NIBS for cognitive impairment after a stroke to obtain new insights. This study was prospectively registered with the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (CRD42020183298). Methods: All English articles from MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL were searched from inception up to 31 December 2020. Randomized and prospective controlled trials were included for the analysis. Studies with at least five individuals post-stroke, whereby at least five sessions of NIBS were provided and using standardized neuropsychological measurement of cognition, were included. We assessed the methodological quality of selected studies as described in the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scoring system. Results: A total of 10 studies met eligibility criteria. Six studies used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and four studies used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). The pooled sample size was 221 and 196 individuals who received rTMS and tDCS respectively. Eight studies combined general rehabilitation, cognitive training, or additional therapy with NIBS. In rTMS studies, target symptoms included global cognition (n = 4), attention (n = 3), memory (n = 4), working memory (WM) (n = 3), and executive function (n = 2). Five studies selected the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DPLFC) as the stimulation target. One rTMS study selected the right DLPFC as the inhibitory stimulation target. Four of six studies showed significant improvement. In tDCS studies, target symptoms included global cognition (n = 2), attention (n = 4), memory (n = 2) and WM (n = 2). Three studies selected the frontal area as the stimulation target. All studies showed significant improvement. In the meta-analysis, rTMS showed a significant effect on attention, memory, WM and global cognition classified by neuropsychological tests. On the other hand, tDCS had no significant effect. Conclusions: In post-stroke patients with deficits in cognitive function, including attention, memory, and WM, NIBS shows promising positive effects. However, this effect is limited, suggesting that further studies are needed with more precision in stimulation sites and stimulation parameters. Future studies using advanced neurophysiological and neuroimaging tools to allow for a network-based approach to treat cognitive symptoms post-stroke with NIBS are warranted.

TI  - Effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation on neurobiological changes in Alzheimer's disease
T2  - MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and brain neuronal loss. A pioneering field of research in AD is brain stimulation via electromagnetic fields (EMFs), which may produce clinical benefits. Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have been developed to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. The purpose of the present review is to identify neurobiological changes, including inflammatory, neurodegenerative, apoptotic, neuroprotective and genetic changes, which are associated with repetitive TMS (rTMS) treatment in patients with AD. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate the effect of TMS treatment in patients with AD and to identify the associated mechanisms. The present review highlights the changes in inflammatory and apoptotic mechanisms, mitochondrial enzymatic activities, and modulation of gene expression (microRNA expression profiles) associated with rTMS or sham procedures. At the molecular level, it has been suggested that EMFs generated by TMS may affect the cell redox status and amyloidogenic processes. TMS may also modulate gene expression by acting on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. TMS may increase brain cortical excitability, induce specific potentiation phenomena, and promote synaptic plasticity and recovery of impaired functions; thus, it may re-establish cognitive performance in patients with AD.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation as Treatment in Multiple Neurologic Conditions
T2  - CURRENT NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a method of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation that is based on electro-physical principles discovered by Michael Faraday. A TMS device is made of one or two copper coils, positioned superficially to a site of interest in the brain, to non-invasively produce a brief magnetic pulse to an estimated depth from the surface of the scalp with the following axonal depolarization. This axonal depolarization activates cortical and subcortical networks with multiple effects. There are different methods of TMS used, all with different mechanisms of action. TMS is well tolerated with very few side effects. Recent Findings TMS is now approved for major depression disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is significant data to consider approval of TMS for many neurological disorders. This is a review of the uses of TMS in diverse neurological conditions, including stroke and spasticity, migraine, and dementia. TMS is a device that utilizes non-invasive brain stimulation, and it has shown promising results with objective clinical and basic science data. Its ability to trigger neuronal plasticity and potentiating synaptic transmission gives it incredible therapeutic potential. There are diverse mechanisms of action, and this could be troublesome in elaborating clinical trials and standardization of therapy.

TI  - Stimulation in Supplementary Motor Area Versus Motor Cortex for Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background and Purpose Freezing of gait (FOG) is a frustrating problem in Parkinson's disease (PD) for which there is no effective treatment. Our aim was to find brain stimulation areas showing greater responses for reducing FOG.
   Methods Twelve PD patients with FOG were selected for indusion. We explored the therapeutic effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the motor cortex (MC). We measured the number of steps, completion time, and freezing episodes during the stand-walk-sit test before and after rTMS treatment. We also tested freezing episodes in two FOG-provoking tasks.
   Results There was a trend for a greater reduction in freezing episodes with SMA stimulation than MC stimulation (p=0.071). FOG was significantly improved after SMA stimulation (p<0.05) but not after MC stimulation.
   Conclusions Our study suggests that the SMA is a more-appropriate target for brain stimulation when treating PD patients with FOG. This study provides evidence that stimulating the SMA using rTMS is beneficial to FOG, which might be useful for future developments of therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Therapeutic noninvasive brain stimulation in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review
   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease without effective pharmacological treatment. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), are increasingly being investigated for their potential to ameliorate the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD).
   Recent findings
   A comprehensive literature review for primary research reports that investigated the ability of TMS/tES to improve cognition in ADRD patients yielded a total of 20 reports since 2016. Eight studies used repetitive TMS and 12 used transcranial direct current stimulation, the most common form of tES. Eight of the studies combined NIBS with cognitive training. Promising results should encourage continued investigation, however there is currently insufficient evidence to support widespread adoption of NIBS-based clinical treatments for ADRD.
   Summary
   NIBS remains an active area of investigation for treatment of ADRD, though the predominance of small, heterogeneous, proof-of-principle studies precludes definitive conclusions. We propose the establishment of a consortium to achieve the benefits of large-scale, controlled studies using biomarker-based diagnostic characterization of participants, development of neurophysiological markers to verify target engagement, and standardization of parameters.

TI  - Diagnostic contribution and therapeutic perspectives of transcranial magnetic stimulation in dementia
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful tool to probe in vivo brain circuits, as it allows to assess several cortical properties such as excitability, plasticity and connectivity in humans. In the last 20 years, TMS has been applied to patients with dementia, enabling the identification of potential markers of the pathophysiology and predictors of cognitive decline; moreover, applied repetitively, TMS holds promise as a potential therapeutic intervention. The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of studies that have employed TMS in dementia and to discuss potential clinical applications, from the diagnosis to the treatment. To provide a technical and theoretical framework, we first present an overview of the basic physiological mechanisms of the application of TMS to assess cortical excitability, excitation and inhibition balance, mechanisms of plasticity and cortico-cortical connectivity in the human brain. We then review the insights gained by TMS techniques into the pathophysiology and predictors of progression and response to treatment in dementias, including Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related dementias and secondary dementias. We show that while a single TMS measure offers low specificity, the use of a panel of measures and/or neurophysiological index can support the clinical diagnosis and predict progression. In the last part of the article, we discuss the therapeutic uses of TMS. So far, only repetitive TMS (rTMS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and multisite rTMS associated with cognitive training have been shown to be, respectively, possibly (Level C of evidence) and probably (Level B of evidence) effective to improve cognition, apathy, memory, and language in AD patients, especially at a mild/early stage of the disease. The clinical use of this type of treatment warrants the combination of brain imaging techniques and/or electrophysiological tools to elucidate neurobiological effects of neurostimulation and to optimally tailor rTMS treatment protocols in individual patients or specific patient subgroups with dementia or mild cognitive impairment.

TI  - TMS-EEG Co-Registration in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's Disease and Other Dementias: A Systematic Review
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - An established method to assess effective brain connectivity is the combined use of transcranial magnetic stimulation with simultaneous electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) because TMS-induced cortical responses propagate to distant anatomically connected brain areas. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are associated with changes in brain networks and connectivity, but the underlying pathophysiology of these processes is poorly defined. We performed here a systematic review of the studies employing TMS-EEG co-registration in patients with dementias. TMS-EEG studies targeting the motor cortex have revealed a significantly reduced TMS-evoked P30 in AD patients in the temporo-parietal cortex ipsilateral to stimulation side as well as in the contralateral fronto-central area, and we have demonstrated a deep rearrangement of the sensorimotor system even in mild AD patients. TMS-EEG studies targeting other cortical areas showed alterations of effective dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity as well as an inverse correlation between prefrontal-to-parietal connectivity and cognitive impairment. Moreover, TMS-EEG analysis showed a selective increase in precuneus neural activity. TMS-EEG co-registrations can also been used to investigate whether different drugs may affect cognitive functions in patients with dementias.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Improves Executive Functioning through Modulation of Social Cognitive Networks in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment: Preliminary Results
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - (1) Background: Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often present impairment in executive functions (EFs). This study aimed to investigate the effect of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on EFs in patients with MCI. (2) Methods: A prospective trial was conducted on 11 patients with MCI. Participants underwent 25 min of 20 Hz rTMS for ten days on the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Before (T0) and after rTMS treatment (T1), global cognitive profile and EFs were investigated using the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA), trial making test (TMT) A and B, and frontal assessment battery (FAB). Depression symptoms were assessed using the geriatric depression scale (GDS). Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon signed-rank test. (3) Results: After treatment, patients showed a significant improvement in the MoCA EFs subtask (T0 vs. T1, p = 0.015) and TMT-B (T0 vs. T1, p = 0.028). Five MCI patients with EF impairment showed full recovery of these deficits. No significant changes in the GDS were observed. (4) Conclusions: rTMS stimulation over the TPJ and MPFC induced significant short-term improvements in EFs in MCI patients. These findings suggest that the TPJ and MPFC may be involved in the attention-executive skills to redirect attention toward behaviorally relevant stimuli.

TI  - Brain stimulation: a therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurological disorders
T2  - CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Brain stimulation has become one of the most acceptable therapeutic approaches in recent years and a powerful tool in the remedy against neurological diseases. Brain stimulation is achieved through the application of electric currents using non-invasive as well as invasive techniques. Recent technological advancements have evolved into the development of precise devices with capacity to produce well-controlled and effective brain stimulation. Currently, most used non-invasive techniques are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), whereas the most common invasive technique is deep brain stimulation (DBS). In last decade, application of these brain stimulation techniques has not only exploded but also expanded to wide variety of neurological disorders. Therefore, in the current review, we will provide an overview of the potential of both non-invasive (rTMS and tDCS) and invasive (DBS) brain stimulation techniques in the treatment of such brain diseases.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for the Neurological Patient: Scientific Principles and Applications
T2  - SEMINARS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Non-invasive brain stimulation has been increasingly recognized for its potential as an investigational, diagnostic and therapeutic tool across the clinical neurosciences. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method of focal neuromodulation. Diagnostically, TMS can be used to probe cortical excitability and plasticity, as well as for functional mapping. Therapeutically, depending on the pattern employed, TMS can either facilitate or inhibit stimulated cortex potentially modulating maladaptive physiology through its effects on neuroplasticity. Despite this potential, applications of TMS in neurology have only been approved for diagnostic clinical neurophysiology, pre-surgical mapping of motor and language cortex, and the treatment of migraines. In this article, we discuss the principles of TMS and its clinical applications in neurology, including experimental applications in stroke rehabilitation, seizures, autism spectrum disorder, neurodegenerative disorders, movement disorders, tinnitus, chronic pain and functional neurological disorder. To promote increased cross-talk across neurology and psychiatry, we also succinctly review the TMS literature for the treatment of major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Overall, we argue that larger clinical trials that are better informed by circuit-level biomarkers and pathophysiological models will lead to an expansion of the application of TMS for patients cared for by neurologists.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment in Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis of its efficacy as a function of protocol characteristics and degree of personalization
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the most common type of neurodegenerative disorder. Although our knowledge on the causes of AD remains limited and no curative treatments are available, several interventions have been proposed in trying to improve patients' symptomatology. Among those, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been shown a promising, safe and noninvasive intervention to improve global cognitive functioning. Nevertheless, we currently lack agreement between research studies on the optimal stimulation protocol yielding the highest efficacy in these patients. To answer this query, we conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus databases and meta-analysis of studies published in the last 10 years (2010-2021) according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Differently from prior published meta-analytic work, we investigated whether protocols that considered participants-specific neuroimaging scans for the selection of individualized stimulation targets held more successful outcomes compared to those relying on a generalized targeting selection criteria. We then compared the effect sizes of subsets of studies based on additional protocol characteristics (frequency, duration of intervention, number of stimulation sites, use of concomitant cognitive training and patients' educational level). Our results confirm TMS efficacy in improving global cognitive functioning in mild-to-moderate AD patients, but also highlight the flaws of current protocols characteristics, including a possible lack of sufficient personalization in stimulation protocols.

TI  - Combining Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Deep Brain Stimulation: Current Knowledge, Relevance and Future Perspectives
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an invasive neuromodulation technique for the treatment of several neurological disorders, but the mechanisms underlying its effects remain partially elusive. In this context, the application of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) in patients treated with DBS represents an intriguing approach to investigate the neurophysiology of cortico-basal networks. Experimental studies combining TMS and DBS that have been performed so far have mainly aimed to evaluate the effects of DBS on the cerebral cortex and thus to provide insights into DBS's mechanisms of action. The modulation of cortical excitability and plasticity by DBS is emerging as a potential contributor to its therapeutic effects. Moreover, pairing DBS and TMS stimuli could represent a method to induce cortical synaptic plasticity, the therapeutic potential of which is still unexplored. Furthermore, the advent of new DBS technologies and novel treatment targets will present new research opportunities and prospects to investigate brain networks. However, the application of the combined TMS-DBS approach is currently limited by safety concerns. In this review, we sought to present an overview of studies performed by combining TMS and DBS in neurological disorders, as well as available evidence and recommendations on the safety of their combination. Additionally, we outline perspectives for future research by highlighting knowledge gaps and possible novel applications of this approach.

TI  - Age-related Deficits in Voluntary Activation: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS & EXERCISE
AB  - Whether there are age-related differences in neural drive during maximal effort contractions is not clear. This review determined the effect of age on voluntary activation during maximal voluntary isometric contractions. The literature was systematically reviewed for studies reporting voluntary activation quantified with the interpolated twitch technique (ITT) or central activation ratio (CAR) during isometric contractions in young (18-35 yr) and old adults (>60 yr; mean, >= 65 yr). Of the 2697 articles identified, 54 were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Voluntary activation was assessed with electrical stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation on five different muscle groups. Random-effects meta-analysis revealed lower activation in old compared with young adults (d = -0.45; 95% confidence interval, -0.62 to -0.29; P < 0.001), with moderate heterogeneity (52.4%). To uncover the sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were conducted for muscle group, calculation method (ITT or CAR), and stimulation type (electrical stimulation or transcranial magnetic stimulation) and number (single, paired, or train stimulations). The age-related reduction in voluntary activation occurred for all muscle groups investigated except the ankle dorsiflexors. Both ITT and CAR demonstrated an age-related reduction in voluntary activation of the elbow flexors, knee extensors, and plantar flexors. ITT performed with paired and train stimulations showed lower activation for old than young adults, with no age difference for the single electrical stimulation. Together, the meta-analysis revealed that healthy older adults have a reduced capacity to activate some upper and lower limb muscles during maximal voluntary isometric contractions; however, the effect was modest and best assessed with at least paired stimulations to detect the difference.

TI  - Impact of methodological variability on EEG responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation: A meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the existing literature on how different parameters of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalogram (EEG) modulate the amplitudes of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs).
   Methods: A comprehensive search was run in PubMed and completed by Google Scholar to find articles studying healthy participants who underwent single pulse TMS-EEG sessions over their left primary motor cortex (M1) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The amplitudes of the most commonly investigated TEP peaks for DLPFC stimulation (positives: 25, 60, 185 ms, negatives: 40, 100 ms) and Ml stimulation (positives: 30, 55,180 ms and negatives: 15, 45, 100, 280 ms) were extracted from studies.
   Results: Cohen's d effect sizes were obtained in five independent categories that were stratified based on the stimulation, recording, and analyzing parameters. The overall effect sizes and equivalent means and standard deviations were computed within every category.
   Conclusions: This meta-analysis spotlights the need to rigorously and systematically control for the critical parameters in recording and analyzing TMS-EEG data to make the outcomes of further studies more comparable to the current body of literature.
   Significance: The study demonstrates the possibility of reliably measuring TEPs by offering approximate ranges for every TEP peak in the most commonly targeted areas of DLPFC and Ml. (C) 2022 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Low-frequency rTMS is better tolerated than high-frequency rTMS in healthy people: Empirical evidence from a single session study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - Low-frequency and high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are similarly efficacious for treatment-resistant depression. Low-frequency is posited to be better tolerated than high-frequency rTMS, however, this is not supported by empirical evidence to date. This study aimed to quantify and compare the tolerability of low-versus high-frequency rTMS. Twenty healthy participants (mean age 38.6 +/- 13.9 years) underwent low- and high-frequency rTMS administered on left frontal, fronto-central and central sites at 100% resting motor threshold. For the low-frequency protocol, 60 s of 1 Hz stimulation was applied at each site and for the high-frequency protocol, 3 x 5 s trains of 10 Hz stimulation with a 30 s inter-train interval were applied at each site. Tolerance for each stimulation type was assessed immediately after stimulation through participant ratings of overall intensity of scalp sensations, pain, muscle twitching, discomfort and any other sensation. Low-frequency rTMS was significantly less intense than high-frequency rTMS in overall intensity, pain, muscle twitching (all p < .01) and discomfort (p < .001). Limitations of this study include the healthy participant sample and administration of a single session of rTMS. While further work is needed in clinical samples using typical rTMS treatment protocols, these data provide the first evidence that low-frequency is better tolerated than high-frequency. These findings may inform clinical practice of rTMS treatment for depression (and other illnesses) by supporting the application of low-frequency protocols.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in cerebral palsy
T2  - POSTEPY PSYCHIATRII I NEUROLOGII
AB  - Purpose: Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the leading causes of child disability, which profoundly affects the lives of whole families and contributes to the burden of health care. Despite the extensive rehabilitative, surgical and other therapeutic efforts of an array of specialists, a significant proportion of patients remain severely disabled. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool in various diseases of the cerebral cortex and cortico-spinal tract (CST). Repetitive TMS (rTMS) is able to induce a long-lasting cerebral plasticity, which is associated with a therapeutic effect in a number of psychiatric and neurological diseases. This article reviews the diagnostic findings gained with TMS in CP as well as therapeutic trials performed with rTMS.
   Views: The absence of responses in the motor cortex in the first months of life, as revealed by TMS, may predict the development of CP in children at risk. In a proportion of children with the unilateral form of CP, TMS documents the pathological preservation of ipsilateral, cortico-spinal connections from the non-lesioned hemisphere, which is associated with poor outcome. rTMS seems to be a safe method with significant therapeutic potential in CP. The data published so far reveals an almost unanimously significant therapeutic benefit in motor performance over placebo. However, the studies conducted to date have almost without exception involved children with unilateral palsy, and have focused nearly exclusively on therapy for motor symptoms.
   Conclusions: Magnetic stimulation brings significant diagnostic and therapeutic effects in CP. However, more studies that go beyond the limits specified above are still awaited.

TI  - Navigating the dementia landscape: Biomarkers and emerging therapies
T2  - AGEING RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB  - The field of dementia research has witnessed significant developments in our understanding of neurodegenerative disorders, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). Dementia, a collection of symptoms arising from the degeneration of brain cells, presents a significant healthcare challenge, especially as its prevalence escalates with age. This abstract delves into the complexities of these disorders, the role of biomarkers in their diagnosis and monitoring, as well as emerging neurophysiological insights. In the context of AD, anti-amyloid therapy has gained prominence, aiming to reduce the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques in the brain, a hallmark of the disease. Notably, Leqembi recently received full FDA approval, marking a significant breakthrough in AD treatment. Additionally, ongoing phase 3 clinical trials are investigating novel therapies, including Masitinib and NE3107, focusing on cognitive and functional improvements in AD patients. In the realm of FTD, research has unveiled distinct neuropathological features, including the involvement of proteins like TDP-43 and progranulin, providing valuable insights into the diagnosis and management of this heterogeneous condition. Biomarkers, including neurofilaments and various tau fragments, have shown promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Neurophysiological techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have contributed to our understanding of AD and FTD. TMS has uncovered unique neurophysiological signatures, highlighting impaired plasticity, hyperexcitability, and altered connectivity in AD, while FTD displays differences in neurotransmitter systems, particularly GABAergic and glutamatergic circuits. Lastly, ongoing clinical trials in anti-amyloid therapy for AD, such as Simufilam, Solanezumab, Gantenerumab, and Remternetug, offer hope for individuals affected by this devastating disease, with the potential to alter the course of cognitive decline. These advancements collectively illuminate the evolving landscape of dementia research and the pursuit of effective treatments for these challenging conditions.

TI  - Supplementary motor area stimulation for Parkinson disease A randomized controlled study
T2  - NEUROLOGY
AB  - Objective: To explore the efficacy and stimulation frequency dependence of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) in Parkinson disease (PD).
   Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, multicenter study with a parallel design, a weekly intervention was performed 8 times. The effects were monitored up to 20 weeks. By central registration, participants were assigned to 1 of 3 arms of the study: low-frequency (1-Hz) rTMS, high-frequency (10-Hz) rTMS, and realistic sham stimulation. The primary end point was the score change of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III from the baseline. Several nonmotor symptom scales such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, apathy score, and nonmotor symptoms questionnaire were defined as secondary end points.
   Results: Of the 106 patients enrolled, 36 were allocated to 1-Hz rTMS, 34 to 10-Hz rTMS, and 36 to realistic sham stimulation. Results show 6.84-point improvement of the UPDRS part III in the 1-Hz group at the last visit of the 20th week. Sham stimulation and 10-Hz rTMS improved motor symptoms transiently, but their effects disappeared in the observation period. Changes in nonmotor symptoms were not clear in any group. No severe adverse event was reported.
   Conclusions: The 1-Hz rTMS over the SMA was effective for motor, but not nonmotor, symptoms in PD.

TI  - Working memory improvement with non-invasive brain stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BRAIN AND COGNITION
AB  - Recent studies have used non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), to increase dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity and, consequently, working memory (WM) performance. However, such experiments have yielded mixed results, possibly due to small sample sizes and heterogeneity of outcomes. Therefore, our aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analyses on NIBS studies assessing the n-back task, which is a reliable index for WM. From the first data available to February 2013, we looked for sham-controlled, randomized studies that used NIBS over the DLPFC using the n-back task in PubMed/MEDLINE and other databases. Twelve studies (describing 33 experiments) matched our eligibility criteria. Active vs. sham NIBS was significantly associated with faster response times (RTs), higher percentage of correct responses and lower percentage of error responses. However, meta-regressions showed that tDCS (vs. rTMS) presented only an improvement in RT, and not in accuracy. This could have occurred in part because almost all tDCS studies employed a crossover design, possibly due to the reliable tDCS blinding. Study design was also associated with no improvement in correct responses in the active vs. sham groups. To conclude, rTMS of the DLPFC significantly improved all measures of WM performance whereas tDCS significantly improved RT, but not the percentage of correct and error responses. Mechanistic insights on the role of DLPFC in WM are further discussed, as well as how NIBS techniques could be used in neuropsychiatric samples presenting WM deficits, such as major depression, dementia and schizophrenia.

TI  - Is non-invasive brain stimulation effective for cognitive enhancement in Alzheimer?s disease? An updated meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) and its preclinical stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), are critical issues confronting the aging society. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have the potential to be effective tools for enhancing cognitive functioning. The main objective of our meta -analysis was to quantify and update the status of the efficacy of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) when applied in AD and MCI.Methods: The systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science according to PRISMA statement.Results: Pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) from 32 studies were analyzed using random effect models. We found both, rTMS and tDCS to have significant immediate cognition-enhancing effect in AD with rTMS inducing also beneficial long-term effects. We found no evidence for synergistic effect of cognitive train-ing with NIBS.Conclusions: In AD a clinical recommendation can be made for NEURO-ADTM system and for high -frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as probably effective protocols (B -level of evidence) and for anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC as a possibly effective.Significance: According to scientific literature, NIBS may be an effective method for improving cognition in AD and possibly in MCI.(c) 2022 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

TI  - Can we manipulate brain connectivity? A systematic review of cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation effects
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) is a form of dual-site transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) entailing a series of single-TMS pulses paired at specific interstimulus intervals (ISI) delivered to distant cortical areas. The goal of this article is to systematically review its efficacy in inducing plasticity in humans focusing on stimulation parameters and hypotheses of underlying neurophysiology.Methods: A systematic review of the literature from 2009-2023 was undertaken to identify all articles utilizing ccPAS to study brain plasticity and connectivity. Six electronic databases were searched and included.Results: 32 studies were identified. The studies targeted connections within the same hemisphere or between hemispheres. 28 ccPAS studies were in healthy participants, 1 study in schizophrenia, and 1 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. 2 additional studies used cortico-cortical repetitive paired associative stimulation (cc-rPAS) in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) patients. Outcome measures include electromyography (EMG), behavioral measures, electroencephalography (EEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). ccPAS seems to be able to modulate brain connectivity depending on the ISI. Conclusions: ccPAS can be used to modulate corticospinal excitability, brain activity, and behavior. Although the stimulation parameters used across studies reviewed in this paper are varied, ccPAS is a promising approach for basic research and potential clinical applications.Significance: Recent advances in neuroscience have caused a shift of interest from the study of single areas to a more complex approach focusing on networks of areas that orchestrate brain activity. Consequently, the TMS community is also witnessing a change, with a growing interest in targeting multiple brain areas rather than a single locus, as evidenced by an increasing number of papers using ccPAS. In light of this new enthusiasm for brain connectivity, this review summarizes existing literature and stimulation parameters that have proven effective in changing electrophysiological, behavioral, or neuroimaging-derived measures.& COPY; 2023 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation to understand pathophysiology and as potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL NEURODEGENERATION
AB  - Common neurodegenerative diseases include Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive and painless method to stimulate the human brain. Single-and paired-pulse TMS paradigms are powerful ways to study the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Motor evoked potential studied with single-pulse TMS is increased in PD, AD and ALS, but is decreased in HD. Changes in motor cortical excitability in neurodegenerative diseases may be related to functional deficits in cortical circuits or to compensatory mechanisms. Reduction or even absence of short interval intracortical inhibition induced by paired-pulse TMS is common in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that there are functional impairments of inhibitory cortical circuits. Decreased short latency afferent inhibition in AD, PD and HD may be related to the cortical cholinergic deficits in these conditions. Cortical plasticity tested by paired associative stimulation or theta burst stimulation is impaired in PD, AD and HD. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) refers to the application of trains of regularly repeating TMS pulses. High-frequency facilitatory rTMS may improve motor symptoms in PD patients whereas low-frequency inhibitory stimulation is a potential treatment for levodopa induced dyskinesia. rTMS delivered both to the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex improves memory in AD patients. Supplementary motor cortical stimulation in low frequency may be useful for HD patients. However, the effects of treatment with multiple sessions of rTMS for neurodegenerative diseases need to be tested in large, sham-controlled studies in the future before they can be adopted for routine clinical practice.

TI  - Neuromodulation for Storage Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Parkinson Disease: A Systematic Review
T2  - NEUROMODULATION
AB  - Background: Bladder symptoms are common in Parkinson disease (PD), affecting quality of life. Medications commonly used such as antimuscarinics can cause frequently intolerable side effects, and therefore, new, better tolerated approaches are needed. Neuromodulation techniques have an established role in urologic disorders; these techniques include tibial nerve stimulation (TNS) and sacral neuromodulation (SNM), which are localized therapies lacking the side effects associated with medication.Objectives: This study aimed to undertake a systematic review of the literature reporting the use of neuromodulation techniques for the treatment of bladder symptoms in PD and related conditions. Materials and Methods: A systematic search of data bases was conducted including MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science. Studies were required to present specific outcomes for individuals with PD for neuromodulation interventions.Results: Ten primary studies were identified concerning detailed outcomes of neuromodulation on bladder symptoms in PD, including seven for TNS, one for SNM, and one using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Two further mixed cohort studies documented minimal data on individuals with PD. All studies demonstrated benefit in a range of outcome measures following neuromodulation. Two randomized sham-controlled studies were carried out using TNS, with one clearly demonstrating supe-riority over sham, although difficulties with achieving believable yet ineffective sham treatment are highlighted. Further studies reported limited, uncontrolled outcomes of SNM in patients with PD, demonstrating benefit. Conclusions: Evidence from case series suggests benefit from TNS in PD, with limited literature on SNM or TMS. Placebo effect from neuromodulation is a concern, and only limited controlled data exist. Future well-designed and sham-controlled studies need to be completed to provide definitive data on the benefit of neuromodulation in PD. Definitively proving the utility of a neuromodulation modality will allow better treatment of bladder symptoms without the need for pharmacologic measures that cause side effects.

TI  - Combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography: Its past, present and future
T2  - BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used to index several neurophysiological processes including excitability, inhibition and plasticity. However, these measures are conventionally limited to the motor cortex and recorded from peripheral muscles. This represents a significant limitation when non-motor neurophysiological processes are of primary interest. In the last several years, TMS has been combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to derive such measures directly from the cortex. Initial studies demonstrated that meaningful recordings could be derived without being substantially affected by TMS stimulus artifact due to advancements in EEG amplifier technology. Subsequently, TMS measures of cortical excitability were reliably recorded and found to be related with more conventional TMS electromyography recordings of excitability in the cortex. More recently, other key neurophysiological indices including cortical inhibition and interhemispheric connectivity have also been reported. In this article, such findings will be reviewed and their importance discussed vis a vis healthy and disease states. We will conclude by highlighting the limitations of this work and discuss their potential future applications as a biomarker of disease states. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Speech and swallowing disorders in Parkinson disease
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY & HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
AB  - Purpose of review
   To review recent research and clinical studies pertaining to the nature, diagnosis, and treatment of speech and swallowing disorders in Parkinson disease.
   Recent findings
   Although some studies indicate improvement in voice and speech with dopamine therapy and deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, others show minimal or adverse effects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the mouth motor cortex and injection of collagen in the vocal folds have preliminary data supporting improvement in phonation in people with Parkinson disease. Treatments focusing on vocal loudness, specifically LSVT LOUD (Lee Silverman Voice Treatment), have been effective for the treatment of speech disorders in Parkinson disease. Changes in brain activity due to LSVT LOUD provide preliminary evidence for neural plasticity. Computer-based technology makes the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment available to a large number of users. A rat model for studying neuropharmacologic effects on vocalization in Parkinson disease has been developed. New diagnostic methods of speech and swallowing are also available as the result of recent studies.
   Summary
   Speech rehabilitation with the LSVT LOUD is highly efficacious and scientifically tested. There is a need for more studies to improve understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of speech and swallowing disorders in Parkinson disease. Keywords

TI  - Interventional psychiatry in the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia: a qualitative review
T2  - SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
AB  - INTRODUCTION: "Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia" (BPSD) refers to a heterogeneous group of clinical manifestations related to dementia, including apathy, depression, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations, sexual or social disinhibition, sleep-wake cycle disturbances, aggression, agitation and other behaviours considered inappropriate. Because of the complexity and heterogeneity of BPSD, as well as the fragility and multimorbidity of the elderly, pharmacological treatment appears to be limited in terms of safety and efficacy, and non-pharmacological therapies are today considered the first choice. There is growing evidence that interventional approaches such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) could be safe and efficient options for several psychiatric illnesses in a population presenting resistance to and/or intolerance of pharmacotherapy.
   AIMS: The aim of the present work is to provide a qualitative review of the state of the art in interventional psychiatry in the treatment of BPSD. A particular focus will be on depression and agitation, which represent major stressors on caregivers and a primary cause of institutionalisation.
   CONCLUSIONS: ECT is probably the most promising interventional procedure needing further investigation in order to obtain specific protocols and a consensus on indications. Preliminary data on rTMS, tDCS, and VNS are encouraging although randomised controlled trials to investigate and compare their efficacy in the treatment of BPSD are still lacking. Their feasibility profile could represent an important advantage over ECT. DBS could represent a very effective therapy for behavioural disorders, but knowledge of the precise neuroanatomical targets for BPSD is currently too limited to justify this invasive approach.

TI  - Therapeutic potential of brain stimulation techniques in the treatment of mental, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders
T2  - CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Treatment for brain diseases has been disappointing because available medications have failed to produce clinical response across all the patients. Many patients either do not respond or show partial and inconsistent effect, and even in patients who respond to the medications have high relapse rates. Brain stimulation has been seen as an alternative and effective remedy. As a result, brain stimulation has become one of the most valuable therapeutic tools for combating against brain diseases. In last decade, studies with the application of brain stimulation techniques not only have grown exponentially but also have expanded to wide range of brain disorders. Brain stimulation involves passing electric currents into the cortical and subcortical area brain cells with the use of noninvasive as well as invasive methods to amend brain functions. Over time, technological advancements have evolved into the development of precise devices; however, at present, most used noninvasive techniques are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), whereas the most common invasive technique is deep brain stimulation (DBS). In the current review, we will provide an overview of the potential of noninvasive (rTMS and tDCS) and invasive (DBS) brain stimulation techniques focusing on the treatment of mental, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders.

TI  - Using non-invasive transcranial stimulation to improve motor and cognitive function in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and cognitive abilities. There is no cure for PD, therefore identifying safe therapies to alleviate symptoms remains a priority. This meta-analysis quantified the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) to improve motor and cognitive dysfunction in PD. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, Library of Congress and Cochrane library were searched. 24 rTMS and 9 TES studies (n = 33) with a sham control group were included for analyses. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Cochrane Risk of Bias showed high quality (7.5/10) and low bias with included studies respectively. Our results showed an overall positive effect in favour of rTMS (SMD = 0.394, CI [0.106-0.683], p = 0.007) and TES (SMD = 0.611, CI [0.188-1.035], p = 0.005) compared with sham stimulation on motor function, with no significant differences detected between rTMS and TES (Q [1] = 0.69, p = 0.406). Neither rTMS nor TES improved cognition. No effects for stimulation parameters on motor or cognitive function were observed. To enhance the clinical utility of non-invasive brain stimulation (NBS), individual prescription of stimulation parameters based upon symptomology and resting excitability state should be a priority of future research.

TI  - Efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation on cognitive functioning in brain disorders: a meta-analysis
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background
   Cognition is commonly affected in brain disorders. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) may have procognitive effects, with high tolerability. This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in improving cognition, in schizophrenia, depression, dementia, Parkinson's disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis.
   Methods
   A PRISMA systematic search was conducted for randomized controlled trials. Hedges' g was used to quantify effect sizes (ES) for changes in cognition after TMS/tDCS v. sham. As different cognitive functions may have unequal susceptibility to TMS/tDCS, we separately evaluated the effects on: attention/vigilance, working memory, executive functioning, processing speed, verbal fluency, verbal learning, and social cognition.
   Results
   We included 82 studies (n = 2784). For working memory, both TMS (ES = 0.17, p = 0.015) and tDCS (ES = 0.17, p = 0.021) showed small but significant effects. Age positively moderated the effect of TMS. TDCS was superior to sham for attention/vigilance (ES = 0.20, p = 0.020). These significant effects did not differ across the type of brain disorder. Results were not significant for the other five cognitive domains.
   Conclusions
   Our results revealed that both TMS and tDCS elicit a small trans-diagnostic effect on working memory, tDCS also improved attention/vigilance across diagnoses. Effects on the other domains were not significant. Observed ES were small, yet even slight cognitive improvements may facilitate daily functioning. While NIBS can be a well-tolerated treatment, its effects appear domain specific and should be applied only for realistic indications (i.e. to induce a small improvement in working memory or attention).

TI  - Comparative Analysis of the Effects of Escitalopram, Pramipexole, and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Depression in Patients With Parkinson Disease: An Open-Label Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to compare the effects of different antidepressant therapies on depression in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and to provide a reference for clinical treatment.
   Methods: A total of 328 patients with idiopathic PD were selected consecutively. Subjects met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disease, Fourth Edition, criteria for a depressive disorder, or operationally defined subsyndromal depression, and scored greater than 17 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17). One hundred thirty-one patients with PD accompanied with depression were enrolled into the experimental group. The subjects were randomly divided into 4 groups, and 118 were eventually completed: routine treatment group (n = 29), routine treatment + escitalopram group (n = 29), routine treatment + pramipexole group (n = 31), and routine treatment + transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) group (n = 29). After 4 weeks of treatments, the efficacy of each treatment was evaluated using HAMD score and reduction rate.
   Results: After 4 weeks of treatment, the HAMD score was used for pair-to-pair comparison between the 4 groups. The therapeutic efficiency of escitalopram, pramipexole, and repetitive TMS was superior to routine anti-PD treatment, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between escitalopram and pramipexole, but all of them were superior to rTMS. Further logistic regression analysis suggested that 50% reduction in HAMD score from baseline was associated with the treatment method. Among them, escitalopram had statistical significance (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Escitalopram, pramipexole, and high-frequency TMS had better efficacy in patients with PD complicated with depression. At 4 weeks, escitalopram showed better antidepressant effects and improved patients' quality of life and did not worsen motor function.

TI  - Effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on cognitive function in healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING
AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on cognitive function in healthy older adults and patients with Alzheimer's disease. A comprehensive literature search was performed on noninvasive stimulation studies published from January 1990 to November 2014 in Pubmed and Web of Science. Fourteen articles with a total of 331 participants were identified as studies with healthy older adults, and the mean effect size and 95% confidence interval were estimated. A significant effect size of 0.42 was found for the cognitive outcome. Further subgroup analyses demonstrated more prominent effects for studies delivering the stimulation before the execution of the task and studies applying multiple sessions of stimulation. To assess the effects of stimulation on Alzheimer's disease patients, 11 studies with a total of 200 patients were included in the analysis. A significant effect size of 1.35 was found for the cognitive outcomes. Subgroup analyses indicated more pronounced effects for studies applying the stimulation during the execution of the task compared with studies delivering the stimulation before the execution of the task. Noninvasive brain stimulation has a positive effect on cognitive function in physiological and pathological aging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The use of theta burst stimulation in patients with schizophrenia - A systematic review
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can offer therapeutic benefits and provide value in neurophysiological research. One of the newer TMS paradigms is theta burst stimulation (TBS) which can be delivered in two patterns: continuous (cTBS - inducing LTD-like effects) and intermittent (iTBS - inducing LTP-like effects). This review paper aims to explore studies that have utilized TBS protocols over different areas of the cortex to study the neurophysiological functions and treatment of patients with schizophrenia. PubMed was searched using the following keywords "schizophrenia", "schizoaffective", or "psychosis", and "theta burst stimulation". Out of the 90 articles which were found, thirty met review inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria included studying the reported effect (clinical, physiological, or both) of at least one session of TBS on human subjects, and abstracts (at minimum) must have been in English. The main target areas included prefrontal cortex (12 studies - 10 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), 2 dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC)) vermal cerebellum (5), and temporo-parietal cortex (8). Other target areas included inferior parietal lobe (2), and motor cortex (3). TBS neurophysiological effect was explored in 5 studies using functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG) and positron emission topography (PET) scan. Overall, TBS can offer great therapeutic potential as it is well-tolerated, feasible, and has few, if any, adverse effects. TBS may be targeted to treat specific symptomatology, as an augmenting intervention to pharmacotherapy, or even improving patient's insight into their diagnosis.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation: treatments for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the neurodegenerative dementias?
T2  - ALZHEIMERS RESEARCH & THERAPY
AB  - Introduction: Two methods of non-invasive brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have demonstrable positive effects on cognition and can ameliorate neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression. Less is known about the efficacy of these approaches in common neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we evaluate the effects of TMS and tDCS upon cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the major dementias, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), as well as the potential pre-dementia states of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Parkinson's disease (PD).
   Methods: PubMed (until 7 February 2014) and PsycINFO (from 1967 to January Week 3 2014) databases were searched in a semi-systematic manner in order to identify relevant treatment studies. A total of 762 studies were identified and 32 studies (18 in the dementias and 14 in PD populations) were included.
   Results: No studies were identified in patients with PDD, FTD or VaD. Of the dementias, 13 studies were conducted in patients with AD, one in DLB, and four in MCI. A total of 16 of the 18 studies showed improvements in at least one cognitive or neuropsychiatric outcome measure. Cognitive or neuropsychiatric improvements were observed in 12 of the 14 studies conducted in patients with PD.
   Conclusions: Both TMS and tDCS may have potential as interventions for the treatment of symptoms associated with dementia and PD. These results are promising; however, available data were limited, particularly within VaD, PDD and FTD, and major challenges exist in order to maximise the efficacy and clinical utility of both techniques. In particular, stimulation parameters vary considerably between studies and are likely to subsequently impact upon treatment efficacy.

TI  - Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis of the Default Mode and Salience Network for Target Identification in Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation of Alzheimer's Disease and Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Background: The accurate choice of the site of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is an important factor in trial design.
   Objective: Based on the observation that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) affect specific large-scale networks, i.e., the default mode network (DMN) and the salience network (SN), respectively, we aimed to identify population-average coordinates of these networks that could be used as potential targets in NIBS trials aiming to modulate these circuits.
   Methods: A systematic literature search of resting-state functional MRI studies reporting DMN and SN stereotactic coordinateswas performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Coordinate-based meta-analyses were conducted to identify consistent nodes of the DMN and SN using Ginger ALE Brain Map software and the activation likelihood estimation method.
   Results: DMN coordinates mapped primarily to mesial areas (posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus [Brodmann Area - BA 23/31] and medial prefrontal cortex [BA 9/10/32]). More superficial areas mapped to the bilateral parietal (angular gyrus [BA 39]), temporal (middle gyrus [BA 21]) and dorsolateral prefrontal (superior gyrus [BA 8]) cortex. SN coordinates mapped primarily to mesial and deep frontal areas (anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex [BA 24/32]), but more superficial areas mapped to the bilateral parietal (supramarginal gyrus [BA 40]) and the right dorsolateral prefrontal (middle gyrus [BA 9/10]) cortex.
   Conclusions: NIBS should target the bilateral angular, the middle temporal cortex, or superior frontal gyri in AD for DMN modulation, and the right middle frontal or supramarginal gyri in bvFTD for SN modulation.

TI  - The clinical diagnostic utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation: Report of an IFCN committee
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - The review focuses on the clinical diagnostic utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The central motor conduction time (CMCT) is a sensitive method to detect myelopathy and abnormalities may be detected in the absence of radiological changes. CMCT may also detect upper motor neuron involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The diagnostic sensitivity may be increased by using the triple stimulation technique (TST), by combining several parameters such as CMCT, motor threshold and silent period, or by studying multiple muscles. In peripheral facial nerve palsies, TMS may be used to localize the site of nerve dysfunction and clarify the etiology. TMS measures also have high sensitivity in detecting lesions in multiple sclerosis and abnormalities in CMCT or TST may correlate with motor impairment and disability. Cerebellar stimulation may detect lesions in the cerebellum or the cerebellar output pathway. TMS may detect upper motor neuron involvement in patients with atypical parkinsonism and equivocal signs. The ipsilateral silent period that measures transcallosal inhibition is a potential method to distinguish between different parkinsonian syndromes. Short latency afferent inhibition (SAI), which is related to central cholinergic transmission, is reduced in Alzheimer's disease. Changes in SAI following administration of cholinesterase inhibitor may be related to the long-term efficacy of this treatment. The results of MEP measurement in the first week after stroke correlate with functional outcome. We conclude that TMS measures have demonstrated diagnostic utility in myelopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. TMS measures have potential clinical utility in cerebellar disease, dementia, facial nerve disorders, movement disorders, stroke, epilepsy, migraine and chronic pain.

TI  - Traumatic brain injury and rTMS-ERPs: Case report and literature review
T2  - OPEN LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Currently, there are no cases of targeted, individualized repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment based on event-related potential (ERPs) results showing the activation of functional brain regions. The identification and treatment of mild cognitive impairment after traumatic brain injury are challenging. rTMS has shown unique advantages in previous studies, with positive effects on noninvasive modulation and neuroplasticity after brain injury. The selection of the rTMS parameters and targets remains controversial. ERPs indicate the cortical activity involved in cognitive processing in patients. Therefore, this study proposes that ERPs can be used as biomarkers of cognitive recovery. The results of this study will guide the development of rTMS protocols for patient treatment. To help clinicians better apply rTMS and ERPs in combination, we conducted a relevant literature review and discussion, detailing the therapeutic mechanisms of the combination of ERPs and rTMS. This will facilitate the precise assessment and personalized treatment of such patients, improve the abnormal processing patterns of patients, and promote their return to life and society.

TI  - Clinical Epidemiology, Evaluation, and Management of Dementia in Parkinson Disease
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE AND OTHER DEMENTIAS
AB  - The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease (PD) will increase substantially, due to the aging of the population and improved treatments leading to better disease-related outcomes. Dementia is the most common nonmotor symptom in PD, and most patients with PD will have cognitive dysfunction and cognitive decline in the course of their disease. The development of cognitive dysfunction in PD greatly limits the ability to participate in activities of daily living and can be a tipping point for nursing home placement or major caregiver stress. Understanding the different causes of dementia and how to reduce the incidence and impact of secondary cognitive dysfunction in PD are necessary skills for primary care physicians and neurologists. In this review, we discuss the clinical epidemiology of dementia in PD with an emphasis on preventable cognitive dysfunction, present tools for outpatient evaluation of cognitive dysfunction, and describe current pharmacological treatments for dementia in PD.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment of Cortical Excitability in Alzheimer's Dementia and Its Association with Clinical Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) due to underlying neurodegenerative pathology. Some studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have shown increased epileptiform and epileptic activity in AD.
   Objective: This review and meta-analyses aims to synthesize the existing evidence for quantitative abnormalities of cortical excitability in AD and their relationship with clinical symptoms.
   Methods: We systematically searched and reviewed publications that quantitatively assessed cortical excitability, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) resting motor threshold (rMT), active motor threshold (aMT), motor evoked potential (MEP) or directly from the cortex using TMS-EEG via TMS-evoked potential (TEP). We meta-analyzed studies that assessed rMT and aMT using random effects model.
   Results: We identified 895 publications out of which 37 were included in the qualitative review and 30 studies using rMT or aMT were included in the meta-analyses. The AD group had reduced rMT (Hedges' g = -0.99, 95% CI [-1.29, -0.68], p < 0.00001) and aMT (Hedges' g = -0.87, 95% CI [-1.50, -0.24], p < 0.00001) as compared with control groups, indicative of higher cortical excitability. Qualitative review found some evidence of increased MEP amplitude, whereas findings related to TEP were inconsistent. There was some evidence supporting an inverse association between cortical excitability and global cognition. No publications reported on the relationship between cortical excitability and NPS.
   Conclusion: There is strong evidence of increased motor cortex excitability in AD and some evidence of an inverse association between excitability and cognition. Future studies should assess cortical excitability from non-motor areas using TMS-EEG and examine its relationship with cognition and NPS.

TI  - TMS-EEG responses across the lifespan: Measurement, methods for characterisation and identified responses
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB  - The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) allows probing of the neurophysiology of any neocortical brain area in vivo with millisecond accuracy. TMS-EEG is particularly unique compared with other available neurophysiological methods, as it can measure the state and dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory systems separately. Because of these capabilities, TMS-EEG responses are sensitive to the brain state, and the responses are influenced by brain maturation and ageing, making TMS-EEG a suitable method to study age-specific pathophysiology. In this review, we outline the TMS-EEG measurement procedure, the existing methods used for characterising TMS-EEG responses and the challenges associated with identifying the responses. We also summarise the findings thus far on how TMS-EEG responses change across the lifespan and the TMS-EEG features that separate typical and atypical brain maturation and ageing. Finally, we give an overview of the gaps in current knowledge to provide directions for future studies.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation in Alzheimer's disease: a neurophysiological marker of cortical hyperexcitability
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION
AB  - Recently, neuropathological studies have shown an important motor cortex involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD), even in its early stages, despite the lack of clinically evident motor deficit. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have demonstrated that cortical excitability is enhanced in AD patients. This cortical hyperexcitability is believed to be a compensatory mechanism to execute voluntary movements, despite the progressive impairment of associative cortical areas. At present, it is not clear if these motor cortex excitability changes might be the expression of an involvement of intracortical excitatory glutamatergic circuits or an impairment of inhibitory cholinergic and, to a lesser extent, gabaergic activity. Although the main hypothesis for the pathogenesis of AD remains the degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, the development of specific TMS protocols, such as the paired-pulse TMS and the study of the short-latency afferent inhibition, points out the role of other neurotransmitters, such as gamma-amino-butyric acid, glutamate and dopamine. The potential therapeutic effect of repetitive TMS in restoring or compensating damaged cognitive functions, might become a possible rehabilitation tool in AD patients. Based on different patterns of cortical excitability, TMS may be useful in discriminating between physiological brain aging, mild cognitive impairment, AD and other dementing disorders. The present review provides a perspective of these TMS techniques by further understanding the role of different neurotransmission pathways and plastic remodelling of neuronal networks in the pathogenesis of AD.

TI  - Beyond The Therapeutic Effect of rTMS in Alzheimer's Disease: A Possible Neuroprotective Role of Hippocampal BDNF? : A Minireview
T2  - MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a well known non-invasive brain stimulation procedure which is capable of inducing the expression of the hippocampal BDNF that has been already shown to exert significant neuroprotective and pro-cognitive effects in AD. However, it is nearly impossible directly to evaluate the BDNF expression in humans after rTMS application. Here we summarized the underlying mechanisms of the neuroprotective and procognitive effect of BDNF that can be induced through a region-specific rTMS approach. Additionally, we have also evaluated the role of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in monitoring the BDNF response after rTMS application in Alzheimer's Disease. We have provided strong evidence that rTMS exerts significant neuroprotective and pro-cognitive effects through the expression of hippocampal BDNF. Furthermore, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy might play a critical role in monitoring the BDNF response after rTMS application in AD patients. Such a sophisticated approach might be able to enlighten us on the time-dependent cognitive and neuroprotective correlates of the rtMS application in AD patients.

TI  - Therapeutic Application of rTMS in Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY
AB  - The terms atypical parkinsonian disorders (APDs) and Parkinson plus syndromes are mainly used to describe the four major entities of sporadic neuronal multisystem degeneration: progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (LBD). APDs are characterized by a variety of symptoms and a lack of disease modifying therapies; their treatment thus remains mainly symptomatic. Brain stimulation via repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and noninvasive intervention using a magnetic coil, and it is considered an alternative therapy in various neuropsychiatric pathologies. In this paper, we review the available studies that investigate the efficacy of rTMS in the treatment of these APDs and Parkinson plus syndromes. tau he majority of the studies have shown beneficial effects on motor and nonmotor symptoms, but research is still at a preliminary phase, with large, double-blind studies lacking in the literature.

TI  - Cortical hyperexcitability and plasticity in Alzheimer's disease: developments in understanding and management
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Introduction: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neurophysiological tool that provides important insights into Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A significant body of work utilizing TMS techniques has explored the pathophysiological relevance of cortical hyperexcitability and plasticity in AD and their modulation in novel therapies.Areas Covered: This review examines the technique of TMS, the use of TMS to examine specific features of cortical excitability and the use of TMS techniques to modulate cortical function. A search was performed utilizing the PubMed database to identify key studies utilizing TMS to examine cortical hyperexcitability and plasticity in Alzheimer's dementia. We then translate this understanding to the study of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, examining the underlying neurophysiologic links contributing to these twin signatures, cortical hyperexcitability and abnormal plasticity, in the cortical dysfunction characterizing AD. Finally, we examine utilization of TMS excitability to guide targeted therapies and, through the use of repetitive TMS (rTMS), modulate cortical plasticity.Expert Opinion: The examination of cortical hyperexcitability and plasticity with TMS has potential to optimize and expand the window of therapeutic interventions in AD, though remains at relatively early stage of development.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation of Degenerating Brain: A Comparison of Normal Aging, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's Disease
T2  - CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH
AB  - Although the brain's ability to change constantly in response to external and internal inputs is now well recognized the mechanisms behind it in normal aging and neurodegeneration are less well understood. To gain a better understanding, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used extensively to characterize non-invasively the cortical neurophysiology of the aging and degenerating brain. Furthermore, there has been a surge of studies examining whether repetitive TMS (rTMS) can be used to improve functional deficits in various conditions including normal aging, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The results of these studies in normal aging and neurodegeneration have emerged reasonably coherent in delineating the main pathology in spite of considerable technical limitations, omnipresent methodological variability, and extraordinary patient heterogeneity. Nevertheless, comparing and integrating what is known about TMS measurements of cortical excitability and plasticity in disorders that predominantly affect cortical brain structures with disorders that predominantly affect subcortical brain structures may provide better understanding of normal and abnormal brain aging fostering new. The present review provides a TMS perspective of changes in cortical neurophysiology and neurochemistry in normal aging and neurodegeneration by integrating what is revealed in individual TMS measurements of cortical excitability and plasticity in physiological aging, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, disease. The paper also reflects on current developments in utilizing TMS as a physiologic biomarker to discriminate physiologic aging from neurodegeneration and its potential as a method of therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Noninvasive brain stimulation for the treatment of neurocognitive disorders: right for prime time?
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Purpose of review Neurocognitive disorders are associated with tremendous burden at the level of the individual, the care giver, and society at large. No effective treatments have been discovered to date. Recent findings Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) comprises several promising interventions that have been studied in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Most recent studies have tested transcranial direct current stimulation or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on their own or in combination with other interventions, particularly cognitive training. While most studies were proof-of-principle studies with small sample sizes, combination and long-duration protocols seem to be promising approaches to pursue. Some studies also investigated novel neurophysiological markers as predictors of response to NIBS. NIBS presents several interventional options that are ready to be evaluated using well powered, long-duration trials. These future studies should build on the promising leads from the current literature, including the potential advantage of combining NIBS with other interventions; the delivery of interventions for long durations to assess long-term impact; and the use of neurophysiological markers that could optimize the personalization and efficacy of NIBS.

TI  - A Review of the Effects of Hypoxia, Sleep Deprivation and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on EEG Activity in Humans: Challenges for Drug Discovery for Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH
AB  - Different kinds of challenge can alter cognitive process and electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms in humans. This can provide an alternative paradigms to evaluate treatment effects in drug discovery. Here, we report recent findings on the effects of challenges represented by sleep deprivation (SD), transient hypoxia, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy volunteers on cognitive processes and EEG rhythms to build a knowledge platform for novel research for drug discovery in AD Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sleep pressure enhanced frontal delta rhythms (< 4 Hz) during the night, while SD increased slow rhythms in the theta range (4-7 Hz), and reduced resting state alpha rhythms (8-12 Hz) after the following day. Furthermore, SD transiently affected cognitive performance. In contrast, transient experimental hypoxia induced abnormal posterior resting state delta and alpha rhythms in healthy volunteers that resemble the abnormal EEG rhythms typically recorded in AD patients. However, the relationship between the cognitive and EEG effects of such challenges is poorly understood. TMS reversibly interfered with higher brain functions during EEG recordings, but few studies have investigated the relationship between the cognitive and EEG effects of TMS. In conclusion, SD is the most mature challenge model for testing new drugs for AD. Future investigation is needed to better understand the opportunities offered by TMS and hypoxia challenges.

TI  - Interrogating cortical function with transcranial magnetic stimulation: insights from neurodegenerative disease and stroke
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an accessible, non-invasive technique to study cortical function in vivo. TMS studies have provided important pathophysiological insights across a range of neurodegenerative disorders and enhanced our understanding of brain reorganisation after stroke. In neurodegenerative disease, TMS has provided novel insights into the function of cortical output cells and the related intracortical interneuronal networks. Characterisation of cortical hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and altered motor cortical function in frontotemporal dementia, demonstration of cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are key examples where TMS has led to advances in understanding of disease pathophysiology and potential mechanisms of propagation, with the potential for diagnostic applications. In stroke, TMS methodology has facilitated the understanding of cortical reorganisation that underlie functional recovery. These insights are critical to the development of effective and targeted rehabilitation strategies in stroke. The present review will provide an overview of cortical function measures obtained using TMS and how such measures may provide insight into brain function. Through an improved understanding of cortical function across a range of neurodegenerative disorders, and identification of changes in neural structure and function associated with stroke that underlie clinical recovery, more targeted therapeutic approaches may now be developed in an evolving era of precision medicine.

TI  - Bridging the gap: TMS-EEG from lab to clinic
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS
AB  - The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) has reached technological maturity and has been an object of significant scientific interest for over two decades. CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER BYELORUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN In parallel, accumulating evidence highlights the potential of TMS-EEG as a useful tool in the field of clinical neurosciences. Nevertheless, its clinical utility has not yet been established, partly because technical and methodological limitations have created a gap between an evolving scientific tool and standard clinical practice. Here we review some of the identified gaps that still prevent TMS-EEG moving from science laboratories to clinical practice. The principal and partly overlapping gaps include: 1) complex and laborious application, 2) difficulty in obtaining high-quality signals, 3) suboptimal accuracy and reliability, and 4) insufficient understanding of the neurobiological substrate of the responses. All these four aspects need to be satisfactorily addressed for the method to become clinically applicable and enter the diagnostic and therapeutic arena. In the current review, we identify steps that might be taken to address these issues and discuss promising recent studies providing tools to aid bridging the gaps.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique for focal brain stimulation based on electromagnetic induction where a fluctuating magnetic field induces a small intracranial electric current in the brain. For more than 35 years, TMS has shown promise in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders in adults. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to the TMS technique with a focus on repetitive TMS (rTMS) protocols, particularly theta-burst stimulation (TBS), and relevant rTMS-derived metrics of brain plasticity. We then discuss the TMS-EEG technique, the use of neuronavigation in TMS, the neural substrate of TBS measures of plasticity, the inter- and intraindividual variability of those measures, effects of age and genetic factors on TBS aftereffects, and then summarize alterations of TMS-TBS measures of plasticity in major neurological and psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, depression, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. Finally, we discuss the translational studies of TMS-TBS measures of plasticity and their therapeutic implications.

TI  - Neurostimulation in Alzheimer's disease: from basic research to clinical applications
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - The development of different methods of brain stimulation provides a promising therapeutic tool with potentially beneficial effects on subjects with impaired cognitive functions. We performed a systematic review of the studies published in the field of neurostimulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), from basic research to clinical applications. The main methods of non-invasive brain stimulation are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation. Preliminary findings have suggested that both techniques can enhance performances on several cognitive functions impaired in AD. Another non-invasive emerging neuromodulatory approach, the transcranial electromagnetic treatment, was found to reverse cognitive impairment in AD transgenic mice and even improves cognitive performance in normal mice. Experimental studies suggest that high-frequency electromagnetic fields may be critically important in AD prevention and treatment through their action at mitochondrial level. Finally, the application of a widely known invasive technique, the deep brain stimulation (DBS), has increasingly been considered as a therapeutic option also for patients with AD; it has been demonstrated that DBS of fornix/hypothalamus and nucleus basalis of Meynert might improve or at least stabilize cognitive functioning in AD. Initial encouraging results provide support for continuing to investigate non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation approaches as an adjuvant treatment for AD patients.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - The awareness of the global trends in neuroscience study, especially in the cognitive neuroscience field, should be increased. One notable approach is the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) not only as a research tool but also as a choice for treatment and rehabilitation in neurological disorders, such as post-stroke hemiplegia, visuospatial neglect syndrome, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and psychiatric conditions such as major depression and schizophrenia. All of these occur in significant numbers in highly populated regions. This paper briefly discusses the basic protocols and potential benefits of using TMS with the aim of providing insight that is useful in the design of future public health strategies in highly populated regions with a large neurocognitive burden of disease where this technique is currently underemployed.

TI  - TMS-EEG: CURRENT POSSIBILITIES AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
T2  - ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA
AB  - TMS-EEG is a method based on the combination of navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and multichannel electroencephalography. It allows to assess non-invasively and with high temporal resolution the excitability of various cerebral cortex areas, as well as connectivity between them. TMS-EEG allows to analyze the shape and distribution of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) in space and time. In the article, the fundamentals and technical aspects of the TMS-EEG technique, as well as the physiological mechanisms for the formation of TEP's peaks are discussed in detail. The possibilities of using the method in fundamental research are closely related to its practical application in clinical medicine. Thus, the use of TMS-EEG in the study of the phenomenon of consciousness opens the prospects for developing a new objective criterion for evaluating patients with chronic disorders of consciousness. The study of the neurodegeneration processes by TMS-EEG will reveal diagnostic and prognostic markers of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc. Finally, the TMS-EEG application in epileptology makes possible not only to study the pathophysiological basis of epilepsy, but also to develop therapeutic methods based on suppression of epileptiform discharges with repetitive TMS, controlled by EEG. In Russia, the TMS-EEG method has been introduced both into research and clinical practice at the Research Center of Neurology and other research centers.

TI  - Clinical diagnostic utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation in neurological disorders. Updated report of an IFCN committee
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - The review provides a comprehensive update (previous report: Chen R, Cros D, Curra A, Di Lazzaro V, Lefaucheur JP, Magistris MR, et al. The clinical diagnostic utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation: report of an IFCN committee. Clin Neurophysiol 2008;119(3):504-32) on clinical diagnostic utility of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in neurological diseases. Most TMS measures rely on stimulation of motor cortex and recording of motor evoked potentials. Paired-pulse TMS techniques, incorporating conventional amplitude-based and threshold tracking, have established clinical utility in neurodegener-ative, movement, episodic (epilepsy, migraines), chronic pain and functional diseases. Cortical hyperex-citability has emerged as a diagnostic aid in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Single-pulse TMS measures are of utility in stroke, and myelopathy even in the absence of radiological changes. Short-latency afferent inhibition, related to central cholinergic transmission, is reduced in Alzheimer's disease. The triple stim-ulation technique (TST) may enhance diagnostic utility of conventional TMS measures to detect upper motor neuron involvement. The recording of motor evoked potentials can be used to perform functional mapping of the motor cortex or in preoperative assessment of eloquent brain regions before surgical resection of brain tumors. TMS exhibits utility in assessing lumbosacral/cervical nerve root function, especially in demyelinating neuropathies, and may be of utility in localizing the site of facial nerve pal-sies. TMS measures also have high sensitivity in detecting subclinical corticospinal lesions in multiple sclerosis. Abnormalities in central motor conduction time or TST correlate with motor impairment and disability in MS. Cerebellar stimulation may detect lesions in the cerebellum or cerebello-dentato-thalamo-motor cortical pathways. Combining TMS with electroencephalography, provides a novel method to measure parameters altered in neurological disorders, including cortical excitability, effective connectivity, and response complexity.(c) 2023 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

TI  - The Application of Neuromodulation Technology in Cognitive Impairment of Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - PROGRESS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system in the elderly and the pre-aging period, whose main clinical manifestation is progressive cognitive impairment. Till now, no treatment for AD has been found effective and the drugs can only delay the progression of the disease with limited efficacy, and often accompanied by side effects. In recent years, neuromodulation, as a method of targeting stimulation to regulate the activity of target brain regions, has gained much attention. It has been widely used in the treatment and research of AD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulate cortical neuronal activity and excitability by changing neuronal membrane potential. Clinical studies have shown that these two non-invasive methods can improve cognitive impairment in AD patients to a certain extent. However, due to the low spatial accuracy and various effect sizes, the optimal stimulation target area, parameters and modes of these two methods have not been unified yet. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) can improve cognitive function in AD patients by regulating cognition-related neural circuits and optogenetics stimulation precisely regulates the activity of specific neurons and neural circuits through genetic and optical means. The research results of cognitive function related circuits and specific neurons by the two innovative methods provide a theoretical basis for identifying the injury mechanism of AD cognitive impairment and the therapeutic targets at the level of brain functional network. This paper reviews the application and research status of the above mentioned four typical neuromodulation methods from the aspects of effect, mechanism, stimulation of brain area and stimulation parameters, so as to provide new ideas for the application of neuromodulation in clinical treatment of AD in the future.

Motor decision making is defined as the process by which a motor plan is chosen among a set of competing actions based on the expected value. In the present literature review we discuss evidence from transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies of motor control. We focus primarily on studies of action selection for instructed movements and motor decision making. In the first section, we delve into the usefulness of various TMS paradigms to characterise the contribution of motor areas and distributed brain networks to cued action selection. Then, we address the influence of motivational information (e.g., reward and biomechanical cost) in guiding action choices based on TMS findings. Finally, we conclude that TMS represents a powerful tool for elucidating the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying action choices in humans.

TI  - Synaptic plasticity mechanisms behind TMS efficacy: insights from its application to animal models
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION
AB  - Neural plasticity is defined as a reshape of communication paths among neurons, expressed through changes in the number and weights of synaptic contacts. During this process, which occurs massively during early brain development but continues also in adulthood, specific brain functions are modified by activity-dependent processes, triggered by external as well as internal stimuli. Since transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) produces a non-invasive form of brain cells activation, many different TMS protocols have been developed to treat neurological and psychiatric conditions and proved to be beneficial. Although neural plasticity induction by TMS has been widely assessed on human subjects, we still lack compelling evidence about the actual biological and molecular mechanisms. To support a better comprehension of the involved phenomena, the main focus of this review is to summarize what has been found through the application of TMS to animal models. The hope is that such integrated view will shed light on why and how TMS so effectively works on human subjects, thus supporting a more efficient development of new protocols in the future.

TI  - Evaluation and Treatment of Vascular Cognitive Impairment by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
T2  - NEURAL PLASTICITY
AB  - The exact relationship between cognitive functioning, cortical excitability, and synaptic plasticity in dementia is not completely understood. Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is deemed to be the most common cognitive disorder in the elderly since it encompasses any degree of vascular-based cognitive decline. In different cognitive disorders, including VCI, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be exploited as a noninvasive tool able to evaluate in vivo the cortical excitability, the propension to undergo neural plastic phenomena, and the underlying transmission pathways. Overall, TMS in VCI revealed enhanced cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity that seem to correlate with the disease process and progression. In some patients, such plasticity may be considered as an adaptive response to disease progression, thus allowing the preservation of motor programming and execution. Recent findings also point out the possibility to employ TMS to predict cognitive deterioration in the so-called "brains at risk" for dementia, which may be those patients who benefit more of disease-modifying drugs and rehabilitative or neuromodulatory approaches, such as those based on repetitive TMS (rTMS). Finally, TMS can be exploited to select the responders to specific drugs in the attempt to maximize the response and to restore maladaptive plasticity. While no single TMS index owns enough specificity, a panel of TMS-derived measures can support VCI diagnosis and identify early markers of progression into dementia. This work reviews all TMS and rTMS studies on VCI. The aim is to evaluate how cortical excitability, plasticity, and connectivity interact in the pathophysiology of the impairment and to provide a translational perspective towards novel treatments of these patients. Current pitfalls and limitations of both studies and techniques are also discussed, together with possible solutions and future research agenda.

TI  - Translational Challenge Models in Support of Efficacy Studies: Neurobehavioral and Cognitive Changes Induced by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Healthy Volunteers
T2  - CNS & NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS-DRUG TARGETS
AB  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was proposed as a neurophysiological tool almost three decades ago. It now encompasses a very wide range of applications including clinical research and the treatment of psychiatric, neurologic and medical conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, addictions, post-traumatic stress disorders, pain, migraine, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, autism, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. By inducing electrical brain responses through the administration of magnetic pulses, TMS is in a unique position to painlessly modulate cortical regions and offers good spatial resolution and excellent temporal resolution, particularly when applied using single pulses. However, despite the impressive number of papers describing the use of TMS to modulate cognitive functions, the mechanisms underlying the behavioral changes observed after stimulation have not been fully identified. Here we present a review of the ability of TMS to transiently compromise brain function in humans. The primary aim was to investigate its capacity for use as a 'cognitive challenge model' in human pharmacological studies. The data reviewed include findings on executive function, attention and episodic memory. For each cognitive process, the convergent and divergent results are discussed in terms of paradigm differences and in order to define the optimal methodology for obtaining the desired effects.

TI  - Neuronal STING activation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia
T2  - ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA
AB  - The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While prior studies have focused on STING within immune cells, little is known about STING within neurons. Here, we document neuronal activation of the STING pathway in human postmortem cortical and spinal motor neurons from individuals affected by familial or sporadic ALS. This process takes place selectively in the most vulnerable cortical and spinal motor neurons but not in neurons that are less affected by the disease. Concordant STING activation in layer V cortical motor neurons occurs in a mouse model of C9orf72 repeat-associated ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). To establish that STING activation occurs in a neuron-autonomous manner, we demonstrate the integrity of the STING signaling pathway, including both upstream activators and downstream innate immune response effectors, in dissociated mouse cortical neurons and neurons derived from control human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Human iPSC-derived neurons harboring different familial ALS-causing mutations exhibit increased STING signaling with DNA damage as a main driver. The elevated downstream inflammatory markers present in ALS iPSC-derived neurons can be suppressed with a STING inhibitor. Our results reveal an immunophenotype that consists of innate immune signaling driven by the STING pathway and occurs specifically within vulnerable neurons in ALS/FTD.

TI  - Utility of Transcranial Magnetic Simulation in Studying Upper Motor Neuron Dysfunction in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by progressive dysfunction of the upper and lower motor neurons. The disease can evolve over time from focal limb or bulbar onset to involvement of other regions. There is some clinical heterogeneity in ALS with various phenotypes of the disease described, from primary lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy and flail arm/leg phenotypes. Whilst the majority of ALS patients are sporadic in nature, recent advances have highlighted genetic forms of the disease. Given the close relationship between ALS and frontotemporal dementia, the importance of cortical dysfunction has gained prominence. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive neurophysiological tool to explore the function of the motor cortex and thereby cortical excitability. In this review, we highlight the utility of TMS and explore cortical excitability in ALS diagnosis, pathogenesis and insights gained from genetic and variant forms of the disease.

TI  - Low-Frequency Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (LF-TMS) in Treating Depression in Patients With Impaired Cognitive Functioning
T2  - ARCHIVES OF CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Common methodologies for treating depressive symptoms have demonstrated decreased efficacy among individuals with impaired cognitive functioning. While transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been approved to treat major depressive disorder, few studies have analyzed the ability of TMS to treat depressive symptoms among individuals with cognitive impairments. The present study had two objectives: to determine whether low-frequency TMS (LF-TMS) might demonstrate efficacy in treating depressive symptoms among individuals with impaired cognitive functioning; and to determine whether LF-TMS might improve neurocognitive functioning above and beyond depressive symptom improvements.
   Methods: Data were derived from a pre-existing database at Eastern Virginia Medical School. Fifty-three (N=53) participants completed LF-TMS treatment. The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and CNS Vital Signs (CNS-VS) neurocognitive assessment were administered at multiple time points throughout treatment. Participants were classified as impaired cognitive functioning or average cognitive functioning based on baseline CNS-VS scores. Data were analyzed using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) measures-within-persons longitudinal hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) with time-varying covariates.
   Results: LF-TMS produced significant reductions in depressive symptoms for individuals in both cognitive functioning groups; however, a significant group-by-time interaction indicates differential effects between these two groups. Low-frequency TMS produced significant improvements in three neurocognitive domains above and beyond improvements in depressive symptoms; however, the reliability of these changes may be questionable.
   Conclusions: This study adds to the growing body of empirical findings for LF-TMS treatment in improving neurocognitive functioning above and beyond other treatment-related effects.

TI  - Neuromodulation in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: Current and Emerging Approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Neuromodulation as a treatment strategy for psychiatric and neurological diseases has grown in popularity in recent years, with the approval of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of depression being one such example. These approaches offer new hope in the treatment of diseases that have proven largely intractable to traditional pharmacological approaches. For this reason, neuromodulation is increasingly being explored for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, such approaches have variable, and, in many cases, very limited evidence for safety and efficacy, with most human evidence obtained in small clinical trials. Here we review work in animal models and humans with Alzheimer's disease exploring emerging neuromodulation modalities. Approaches reviewed include deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, ultrasound stimulation, photobiomodulation, and visual or auditory stimulation. In doing so, we clarify the current evidence for these approaches in treating Alzheimer's disease and identify specific areas where additional work is needed to facilitate their clinical translation.

TI  - UPDATES ON THE USE OF NON-INVASIVE BRAIN STIMULATION IN PHYSICAL AND REHABILITATION MEDICINE
T2  - JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION MEDICINE
AB  - Brain stimulation for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases has been used for more than 50 years. Although its development has been slow, current advances in the techniques of brain stimulation have improved its clinical efficacy. The use of non-invasive brain stimulation has significant advantages, such as not involving surgical procedures and having relatively, mild adverse effects. In this paper we briefly review the use of 2 non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), as therapeutic approaches in physical and rehabilitation medicine. We also compare the effects of non-invasive central nervous system stimulation with techniques of non-invasive peripheral electrical stimulation, in order to provide new insights for future developments. Although the outcomes of these initial trials include some conflicting results, the evidence supports that rTMS and tDCS might have a therapeutic value in different neurological conditions. Studies published within the last year have examined new approaches of stimulation, such as longer intensities of stimulation, new electrode sizes for tDCS, novel coils for stimulation of deeper areas, and new frequencies of stimulation for rTMS. These new approaches need to be tested in larger clinical trials in order to determine whether them, offer significant clinical effects.

TI  - Vascular Cognitive Impairment through the Looking Glass of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY
AB  - In the last years, there has been a significant growth in the literature exploiting transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with the aim at gaining further insights into the electrophysiological and neurochemical basis underlying vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Overall, TMS points at enhanced brain cortical excitability and synaptic plasticity in VCI, especially in patients with overt dementia, and neurophysiological changes seem to correlate with disease process and progress. These findings have been interpreted as part of a glutamate-mediated compensatory effect in response to vascular lesions. Although a single TMS parameter owns low specificity, a panel of measures can support the VCI diagnosis, predict progression, and possibly identify early markers of "brain at risk" for future dementia, thus making VCI a potentially preventable cause of both vascular and degenerative dementia in late life. Moreover, TMS can be also exploited to select and evaluate the responders to specific drugs, as well as to become an innovative rehabilitative tool in the attempt to restore impaired neural plasticity. The present review provides a perspective of the different TMS techniques by further understanding the cortical electrophysiology and the role of distinctive neurotransmission pathways and networks involved in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of VCI and its subtypes.

TI  - Novel Therapeutic Approaches for Alzheimer's Disease: An Updated Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and accounts for most cases of dementia. The prevalence of AD has increased in the current rapidly aging society and contributes to a heavy burden on families and society. Despite the profound impact of AD, current treatments are unable to achieve satisfactory therapeutic effects or stop the progression of the disease. Finding novel treatments for AD has become urgent. In this paper, we reviewed novel therapeutic approaches in five categories: anti-amyloid therapy, anti-tau therapy, anti-neuroinflammatory therapy, neuroprotective agents including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulators, and brain stimulation. The trend of therapeutic development is shifting from a single pathological target to a more complex mechanism, such as the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. While drug repositioning may accelerate pharmacological development, non-pharmacological interventions, especially repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), also have the potential for clinical application. In the future, it is possible for physicians to choose appropriate interventions individually on the basis of precision medicine.

TI  - Synaptic Effects of Palmitoylethanolamide in Neurodegenerative Disorders
T2  - BIOMOLECULES
AB  - Increasing evidence strongly supports the key role of neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neuroinflammation may alter synaptic transmission contributing to the progression of neurodegeneration, as largely documented in animal models and in patients' studies. In the last few years, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), an endogenous lipid mediator, and its new composite, which is a formulation constituted of PEA and the well-recognized antioxidant flavonoid luteolin (Lut) subjected to an ultra-micronization process (co-ultraPEALut), has been identified as a potential therapeutic agent in different disorders by exerting potential beneficial effects on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation by modulating synaptic transmission. In this review, we will show the potential therapeutic effects of PEA in animal models and in patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Non-pharmacological intervention effects on apathy caused by central nervous system organic diseases: A network meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
AB  - Background: To evaluate the best non-pharmacological interventions on apathy in patients with central nervous system (CNS) organic diseases. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library electronic databases, China national knowledge infrastructure, Wanfang and Chinese biomedical literature database studies published from 2011 to May 29, 2021. A combination of subject words and free words were used for searching. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of non-pharmacological interventions for apathy in patients with central nervous organic disease were included. Two researchers independently identified the eligible RCTs and extracted information. The risk of bias within each individual trial was assessed using the Cocharane Collaboration's tool. Review Manager 5.4 and ADDIS 1.16.5 were used for data analysis. Results: A total of 5324 related studies were obtained in the initial screening, and final 8 RCTs including 334 patients were included, involving 4 non-pharmacological interventions of cognitive intervention, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), music therapy and occupational therapy. Direct comparison results showed that rTMS, cognitive intervention, and occupational therapy were superior to the conventional group (P < .05). Network Meta repeated rTMS, cognitive intervention was superior to the conventional group (P < .05), while the other groups did not differ from with the conventional group (P > .05). The order of superiority was rTMS, cognitive intervention, occupational therapy, music therapy, and conventional group. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that rTMS and cognitive interventions are more effective than the conventional intervention in improving apathy in patients with CNS organic diseases. It still needs more non-pharmacological intervention studies with high quality, larger sample sizes for further exploration.

TI  - The neural basis of semantic cognition: Converging evidence from neuropsychology, neuroimaging and TMS
T2  - CORTEX
AB  - Recent studies suggest that a complex, distributed neural network underpins semantic cognition. This article reviews our contribution to this emerging picture and traces the putative roles of each region within this network. Neuropsychological studies indicate that semantic cognition draws on at least two interacting components: semantic representations [degraded in semantic dementia (SD)] and control processes [deficient in patients with multimodal semantic impairment following stroke aphasia (SA)]. To explore the first component, we employed distortion-corrected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy volunteers: these studies convergently indicated that the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs; atrophied in SD) combine information from different modalities within an amodal semantic "hub". Regions of cortex that code specific semantic features ("spokes") also make a critical contribution to knowledge within particular categories. This network of brain regions interacts with semantic control processes reliant on left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) and inferior parietal cortices. SA patients with damage to these regions have difficulty focussing on aspects of knowledge that are relevant to the current goal or context, in both verbal and non-verbal tasks. SA patients with LIFG and temporoparietal lesions show similar deficits of semantic control, suggesting that a large-scale distributed cortical network underpins semantic control. Convergent evidence is again provided by fMRI and TMS. We separately manipulated the representational and control demands of a semantic task in fMRI, and found a dissociation within the temporal lobe: ATL was sensitive to the number of meanings retrieved, while pMTG and LIFG showed effects of semantic selection. Moreover, TMS to LIFG and pMTG produced equal disruption of tasks tapping semantic control. The next challenges are to delineate the specific roles of each region within the semantic control network and to specify the way in which control processes interact with semantic representations to focus processing on relevant features of concepts.

TI  - Multi-site rTMS with cognitive training improves apathy in the long term in Alzheimer's disease: A 4-year chart review
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: To assess the long-term effects of multi-site repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with cognitive training (NeuroAD procedure) on cognitive symptoms and apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as part of a 4-year chart review. Methods: The study included the 30 AD patients who underwent NeuroAD treatment between 2015 and 2019 at our center. The clinical evaluation was based on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and Apathy Inventory (AI). Assessment was performed before treatment (baseline), after an initial 6-week protocol of 30 sessions (M1.5), then 3 months (M3), 1 year (M12), and between 1.5 and 4 years (mean 28 months, M28) after treatment initiation. Results: During the first year of follow-up, the AI score improved at all time points (M1.5, M3, M12, p < 0.0001), the ADAS-Cog score improved at the end of the initial procedure (M1.5, p = 0.003) then deteriorated (M12, p = 0.01), while the MMSE score did not change. At final assessment (M28), the AI score was still improved from baseline (p < 0.0001), while the MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores worsened (p < 0.0001). Regarding the ADAS-Cog score, the prolonged improvement at M12 or M28 was correlated with the initial improvement at M1.5. Conclusion: The NeuroAD procedure produced long-term improvement in apathy and more general cognitive improvement only in patients who responded well to the initial 6-week protocol. Significance: Our results suggest long-term beneficial effects of the NeuroAD procedure on apathy, which need to be confirmed in controlled studies. The criteria for predicting a good outcome before starting the procedure remain to be defined. CO 2022 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease: Are We Ready?
T2  - ENEURO
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is among a growing family of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques being developed to treat multiple neurocognitive disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although small clinical trials in AD have reported positive effects on cognitive outcome measures, significant knowledge gaps remain, and little attention has been directed at examining the potential influence of TMS on AD pathogenesis. Our review briefly outlines some of the proposed neurobiological mechanisms of TMS benefits in AD, with particular emphasis on the modulatory effects on excitatory/inhibitory balance. On the basis of converging evidence from multiple fields, we caution that TMS therapeutic protocols established in young adults may have unexpected detrimental effects in older individuals or in the brain compromised by AD pathology. Our review surveys clinical studies of TMS in AD alongside basic research as a guide for moving this important area of work forward toward effective treatment development.

TI  - Noninvasive brain stimulation in Alzheimer's disease: Systematic review and perspectives for the future
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY
AB  - Background: A number of studies have applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to physiologically characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to monitor effects of pharmacological agents, while others have begun to therapeutically use TMS and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to improve cognitive function in AD. These applications are still very early in development, but offer the opportunity of learning from them for future development.
   Methods: We performed a systematic search of all studies using noninvasive stimulation in AD and reviewed all 29 identified articles. Twenty-four focused on measures of motor cortical reactivity and (local) plasticity and functional connectivity, with eight of these studies assessing also effects of pharmacological agents. Five studies focused on the enhancement of cognitive function in AD.
   Results: Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and resting motor threshold are significantly reduced in AD patients as compared to healthy elders. Results on other measures of cortical reactivity, e.g. intracortical inhibition (ICI), are more divergent. Acetylcholine-esterase inhibitors and dopaminergic drugs may increase SAI and ICI in AD. Motor cortical plasticity and connectivity are impaired in AD. TMS/tDCS can induce acute and short-duration beneficial effects on cognitive function, but the therapeutic clinical significance in AD is unclear. Safety of TMS/tDCS is supported by studies to date.
   Conclusions: TMS/tDCS appears safe in AD, but longer-term risks have been insufficiently considered. TMS holds promise as a physiologic biomarker in AD to identify therapeutic targets and monitor pharmacologic effects. In addition, TMS/tDCS may have therapeutic utility in AD, though the evidence is still very preliminary and cautious interpretation is warranted. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation in animal models of neurodegeneration
T2  - NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH
AB  - Brain stimulation techniques offer powerful means of modulating the physiology of specific neural structures. In recent years, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation, have emerged as therapeutic tools for neurology and neuroscience. However, the possible repercussions of these techniques remain unclear, and there are few reports on the incisive recovery mechanisms through brain stimulation. Although several studies have recommended the use of non-invasive brain stimulation in clinical neuroscience, with a special emphasis on TMS, the suggested mechanisms of action have not been confirmed directly at the neural level. Insights into the neural mechanisms of non-invasive brain stimulation would unveil the strategies necessary to enhance the safety and efficacy of this progressive approach. Therefore, animal studies investigating the mechanisms of TMS-induced recovery at the neural level are crucial for the elaboration of non-invasive brain stimulation. Translational research done using animal models has several advantages and is able to investigate knowledge gaps by directly targeting neuronal levels. In this review, we have discussed the role of TMS in different animal models, the impact of animal studies on various disease states, and the findings regarding brain function of animal models after TMS in pharmacology research.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation Applications to Memory in Healthy Aging
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - It has long been acknowledged that memory changes over the course of one's life, irrespective of diseases like dementia. Approaches to mitigate these changes have however yielded mixed results. Brain stimulation has been identified as one novel approach of augmenting older adult's memory. Thus far, such approaches have however been nuanced, targeting different memory domains with different methodologies. This has produced an amalgam of research with an unclear image overall. This systematic review therefore aims to clarify this landscape, evaluating, and interpreting available research findings in a coherent manner. A systematic search of relevant literature was conducted across Medline, PsycInfo, Psycarticles and the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, which uncovered 44 studies employing non-invasive electrical brain stimulation in healthy older adults. All studies were of generally good quality spanning numerous memory domains. Within these, evidence was found for non-invasive brain stimulation augmenting working, episodic, associative, semantic, and procedural memory, with the first three domains having the greatest evidence base. Key sites for stimulation included the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), temporoparietal region, and primary motor cortex, with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) holding the greatest literature base. Inconsistencies within the literature are highlighted and interpreted, however this discussion was constrained by potential confounding variables within the literature, a risk of bias, and challenges defining research aims and results. Non-invasive brain stimulation often did however have a positive and predictable impact on older adult's memory, and thus warrants further research to better understand these effects.

TI  - Biomarkers for Amyotrophic Latera Sclerosis and Frontotemporal Dementia Associated With Hexanucleotide Expansion Mutations in <i>C9orf72</i>
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Now that genetic testing can identify persons at risk for developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) many decades before symptoms begin, there is a critical need for biomarkers that signal the onset and progression of degeneration. The search for candidate disease biomarkers in patients with mutations in the gene C9orf72 has included imaging, physiology, and biofluid measurements. In cross-sectional imaging studies, C9+ ALS patients display diffuse reductions of gray and white matter integrity compared to ALS patients without mutations. This structural imaging signature overlaps with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), reflecting the frequent co-occurrence of cognitive impairment, even frank FTD, in C9+ ALS patients. Changes in functional connectivity occur as critical components of the networks associated with cognition and behavior degenerate. In presymptomatic C9+carriers, subtle differences in volumes of subcortical structures and functional connectivity can be detected, often decades before the typical family age of symptom onset. Dipeptide repeat proteins produced by the repeat expansion mutation are also measurable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of presymptomatic gene carriers, possibly throughout their lives. In contrast, a rise in the level of neurofilament proteins in the CSF appears to presage the onset of degeneration in presymptomatic carriers in one longitudinal study. Cross-sectional studies indicate that neurofilament protein levels may provide prognostic information for survival in C9+ ALS patients. Longitudinal studies will be needed to validate the candidate biomarkers discussed here. Understanding how these candidate biomarkers change over time is critical if they are to be used in future therapeutic decisions.

TI  - The Role of White Matter Dysfunction and Leukoencephalopathy/Leukodystrophy Genes in the Aetiology of Frontotemporal Dementias: Implications for Novel Approaches to Therapeutics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common cause of presenile dementia and is characterized by behavioural and/or language changes and progressive cognitive deficits. Genetics is an important component in the aetiology of FTD, with positive family history of dementia reported for 40% of cases. This review synthesizes current knowledge of the known major FTD genes, including C9orf72 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72), MAPT (microtubule-associated protein tau) and GRN (granulin), and their impact on neuronal and glial pathology. Further, evidence for white matter dysfunction in the aetiology of FTD and the clinical, neuroimaging and genetic overlap between FTD and leukodystrophy/leukoencephalopathy are discussed. The review highlights the role of common variants and mutations in genes such as CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor), CYP27A1 (cytochrome P450 family 27 subfamily A member 1), TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) and TMEM106B (transmembrane protein 106B) that play an integral role in microglia and oligodendrocyte function. Finally, pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches for enhancing remyelination are discussed in terms of future treatments of FTD.

TI  - Cognitive effects of focal neuromodulation in neurological and psychiatric disorders
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Focal direct-to-brain neuromodulation approaches, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS) and ablative techniques, hold tremendous therapeutic promise for challenging-to-treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. These interventions modulate brain circuits that contribute to clinical symptoms and overlap with the networks that support cognition. Depending on the reason for the intervention - whether it aims to improve clinical symptoms or cognitive symptoms - focal neuromodulation techniques might indirectly or directly affect cognitive processes. In this Review, we examine the effects of repetitive TMS, DBS and ablative techniques on post-intervention cognition in patients with psychiatric disorders (major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and schizophrenia) and neurological conditions (Parkinson disease, essential tremor and Alzheimer disease). Our findings indicate that focal neuromodulation is generally safe from a cognitive standpoint and, in some cases, can improve aspects of cognition. We conclude with methodological recommendations aimed at advancing our knowledge of the cognitive effects associated with focal neuromodulation approaches.
   Focal neuromodulation approaches are promising therapeutic options for challenging-to-treat neurological and psychiatric symptoms, but might indirectly or directly affect cognition. In this Review, Rabin et al. describe the cognitive effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation and ablative techniques.

TI  - The contribution of TMS-EEG coregistration in the exploration of the human cortical connectome
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Recent developments in neuroscience have emphasised the importance of integrated distributed networks of brain areas for successful cognitive functioning. Our current understanding is that the brain has a modular organisation in which segregated networks supporting specialised processing are linked through a few long-range connections, ensuring processing integration. Although such architecture is structurally stable, it appears to be flexible in its functioning, enabling long-range connections to regulate the information flow and facilitate communication among the relevant modules, depending on the contingent cognitive demands. Here we show how insights brought by the coregistration of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) integrate and support recent models of functional brain architecture. Moreover, we will highlight the types of data that can be obtained through TMS-EEG, such as the timing of signal propagation, the excitatory/inhibitory nature of connections and causality. Last, we will discuss recent emerging applications of TMS-EEG in the study of brain disorders. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The multidimensionality of abstract concepts: A systematic review
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - The neuroscientific study of conceptual representation has largely focused on categories of concrete entities (biological entities, tools...), while abstract knowledge has been less extensively investigated. The possible presence of a categorical organization of abstract knowledge is a debated issue. An embodied cognition framework predicts an organization of the abstract domain into different dimensions, grounded in the brain regions engaged by the corresponding experience. Here we review the types of experience that have been proposed to characterize different categories of abstract concepts, and the evidence supporting a corresponding organization derived from behavioural, neuroimaging (i.e., fMRI, MRI, PET, SPECT), EEG, and neurostimulation (i.e., TMS) studies in healthy and clinical populations. The available data provide substantial converging evidence in favour of the presence of distinct neural representations of social and emotional knowledge, mental states and magnitude concepts, engaging brain systems involved in the corresponding experiences. This evidence is supporting an extension of embodied models of semantic memory organization to several types of abstract knowledge.

TI  - Cognitive effects and acceptability of non-invasive brain stimulation on Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: a component network meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Objectives To compare cognitive effects and acceptability of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to determine whether cognitive training (CT) during rTMS or tDCS provides additional benefits.
   Methods Electronic search of PubMed, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO up to 5 March 2020. We enrolled double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcomes were acceptability and pre-post treatment changes in general cognition measured by Mini-Mental State Examination, and the secondary outcomes were memory function, verbal fluency, working memory and executive function. Durability of cognitive benefits (1, 2 and >= 3 months) after brain stimulation was examined.
   Results We included 27 RCTs (n=1070), and the treatment components included high-frequency rTMS (HFrTMS) and low-frequency rTMS, anodal tDCS (atDCS) and cathodal tDCS (ctDCS), CT, sham CT and sham brain stimulation. Risk of bias of evidence in each domain was low (range: 0%-11.1%). HFrTMS (1.08, 9, 0.35-1.80) and atDCS (0.56, 0.03-1.09) had short-term positive effects on general cognition. CT might be associated with negative effects on general cognition (-0.79, -2.06 to 0.48) during rTMS or tDCS. At 1-month follow-up, HFrTMS (1.65, 0.77-2.54) and ctDCS (2.57, 0.20-4.95) exhibited larger therapeutic responses. Separate analysis of populations with pure AD and MCI revealed positive effects only in individuals with AD. rTMS and tDCS were well tolerated.
   Conclusions HFrTMS is more effective than atDCS for improving global cognition, and patients with AD may have better responses to rTMS and tDCS than MCI.

TI  - Practice effects in performance outcome measures in patients living with neurologic disorders-A systematic review
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Background: In this systematic review we sought to characterize practice effects on traditional in-clinic or digital performance outcome measures commonly used in one of four neurologic disease areas (multiple sclerosis; Huntington's disease; Parkinson's disease; and Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and other forms of dementia), describe mitigation strategies to minimize their impact on data interpretation and identify gaps to be addressed in future work.Methods: Fifty-eight original articles (49 from Embase and an additional 4 from PubMed and 5 from additional sources; cut-off date January 13, 2021) describing practice effects or their mitigation strategies were included.Results: Practice effects observed in healthy volunteers do not always translate to patients living with neurologic disorders. Mitigation strategies include reliable changes indices that account for practice effects or a run-in period. While the former requires data from a reference sample showing similar practice effects, the latter requires a sufficient number of tests in the run-in period to reach steady-state performance. However, many studies only included 2 or 3 test administrations, which is insufficient to define the number of tests needed in a run-in period.Discussion: Several gaps have been identified. In particular the assessment of practice effects on an individual patient level as well as the temporal dynamics of practice effects are largely unaddressed. Here, digital tests, which allow much higher testing frequency over prolonged periods of time, can be used in future work to gain a deeper understanding of practice effects and to develop new metrics for assessing and accounting for practice effects in clinical research and clinical trials.

TI  - TMS-Induced Motor Evoked Potentials in Wilson's Disease: A Systematic Literature Review
T2  - BIOELECTROMAGNETICS
AB  - Wilson's disease (WD) is a metabolic brain disease resulting from improper copper metabolism. Although pyramidal symptoms are rarely observed, subclinical injury is highly possible as copper accumulates in all brain structures. The usefulness of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in pyramidal tracts damage evaluation still appears to be somehow equivocal. We searched for original papers assessing the value of transcranial magnetic stimulation elicited MEPs with respect to motor function of upper and lower extremity in WD. We searched PubMed for original papers evaluating use of MEPs in WD using key words: motor evoked potentials Wilson's disease and transcranial magnetic stimulation Wilson's disease. We found six articles using the above key words. One additional article and one case report were found while viewing the references lists. Therefore, we included eight studies. Number of patients in studies was low and their clinical characteristic was variable. There were also differences in methodology. Abnormal MEPs were confirmed in 20-70% of study participants. MEPs were not recorded in 7.6-66.7% of patients. Four studies reported significantly increased cortical excitability (up to 70% of patients). Prolonged central motor conduction time was observed in four studies (30-100% of patients). One study reported absent or prolonged central motor latency in 66.7% of patients. Although MEPs may be abnormal in WD, this has not been thoroughly assessed. Hence, further studies are indispensable to evaluate MEPs' usefulness in assessing pyramidal tract damage in WD.

TI  - Noninvasive Brain Stimulation to Enhance Functional Recovery After Stroke: Studies in Animal Models
T2  - NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR
AB  - Background. Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability, but treatment options remain limited, leaving most patients with incomplete recovery. Patient and animal studies have shown potential of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) strategies to improve function after stroke. However, mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects of NIBS are unclear and there is no consensus on which NIBS protocols are most effective. Objective. Provide a review of articles that assessed effects and mechanisms of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in animal stroke models. Methods. Articles were searched in PubMed, including cross-references. Results. Nineteen eligible studies reporting effects of rTMS or tDCS after stroke in small rodents were identified. Seventeen of those described improved functional recovery or neuroprotection compared with untreated control or sham-stimulated groups. The effects of rTMS could be related to molecular mechanisms associated with ischemic tolerance, neuroprotection, anti-apoptosis, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, or neuroplasticity. Favorable outcome appeared most effectively when using high-frequency (>5 Hz) rTMS or intermittent theta burst stimulation of the ipsilesional hemisphere. tDCS effects were strongly dependent on stimulation polarity and onset time. Although these findings are promising, most studies did not meet Good Laboratory Practice assessment criteria. Conclusions. Despite limited data availability, animal stroke model studies demonstrate potential of NIBS to promote stroke recovery through different working mechanisms. Future studies in animal stroke models should adhere to Good Laboratory Practice guidelines and aim to further develop clinically applicable treatment protocols by identifying most favorable stimulation parameters, treatment onset, adjuvant therapies, and underlying modes of action.

TI  - Can noninvasive brain stimulation enhance cognition in neuropsychiatric disorders?
T2  - NEUROPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Cognitive impairment is a core symptom of many neuropsychiatric diseases and a key contributor to the patient's quality of life. However, an effective therapeutic strategy has yet to be developed. Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, namely transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are promising techniques that are under investigation for a variety of otherwise treatment-resistant neuropsychiatric diseases. Notably, these tools can induce alterations in neural networks subserving cognitive operations and thus may provide a means for cognitive restoration. The purpose of this article is to review the available evidence concerning cognitive enhancing properties of noninvasive brain stimulation in neuropsychiatry. We specifically focus on major depression. Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), where cognitive dysfunction is a major symptom and some studies have been completed with promising results. We provide a critical assessment of the available research and suggestions to guide future efforts.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Across the Lifespan: Impact of Developmental and Degenerative Processes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a pivotal noninvasive technique for investigating cortical excitability and plasticity across the lifespan, offering valuable insights into neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes. In this review, we explore the impact of TMS applications on our understanding of normal development, healthy aging, neurodevelopmental disorders, and adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. By presenting key developmental milestones and age-related changes in TMS measures, we provide a foundation for understanding the maturation of neurotransmitter systems and the trajectory of cognitive functions throughout the lifespan. Building on this foundation, the paper delves into the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, and adolescent depression. Highlighting recent findings on altered neurotransmitter circuits and dysfunctional cortical plasticity, we underscore the potential of TMS as a valuable tool for unraveling underlying mechanisms and informing future therapeutic interventions. We also review the emerging role of TMS in investigating and treating the most common adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders and late-onset depression. By outlining the therapeutic applications of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques in these disorders, we discuss the growing body of evidence supporting their use as therapeutic tools for symptom management and potentially slowing disease progression. The insights gained from TMS studies have advanced our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in both healthy and disease states, ultimately informing the development of more targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions.

TI  - Transcranial Magnetic and Electrical Stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementia is an immense personal and public health burden. Available treatments have modest efficacy in reducing symptoms of AD and have no significant impact on the course of the illness. Moreover, attempts to discover novel treatments have to date failed. Noninvasive brain stimulation comprises a suite of interventions that are based on transcranial magnetic or electric stimulation of different brain regions. Promising findings are emerging from two forms of noninvasive brain stimulation: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Here, the results from the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed rTMS or tDCS in AD or in mild cognitive impairment, a clinical state that typically preceded AD, are reviewed. Overall, there are few RCTs, and most of them are limited by small sample sizes. Larger RCTs and additional research are needed to identify the best stimulation parameters for these two interventions.

TI  - Assessing brain plasticity across the lifespan with transcranial magnetic stimulation: why, how, and what is the ultimate goal?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Sustaining brain and cognitive function across the lifespan must be one of the main biomedical goals of the twenty-first century. We need to aim to prevent neuropsychiatric diseases and, thus, to identify and remediate brain and cognitive dysfunction before clinical symptoms manifest and disability develops. The brain undergoes a complex array of changes from developmental years into old age, putatively the underpinnings of changes in cognition and behavior throughout life. A functionally "normal" brain is a changing brain, a brain whose capacity and mechanisms of change are shifting appropriately from one time-point to another in a given individual's life. Therefore, assessing the mechanisms of brain plasticity across the lifespan is critical to gain insight into an individual's brain health. Indexing brain plasticity in humans is possible with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which, in combination with neuroimaging, provides a powerful tool for exploring local cortical and brain network plasticity. Here, we review investigations to date, summarize findings, and discuss some of the challenges that need to be solved to enhance the use of TMS measures of brain plasticity across all ages. Ultimately, TMS measures of plasticity can become the foundation for a brain health index (BHI) to enable objective correlates of an individual's brain health over time, assessment across diseases and disorders, and reliable evaluation of indicators of efficacy of future preventive and therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Cortical hyperexcitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: from pathogenesis to diagnosis
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Purpose of reviewIdentification of upper motor neuron involvement remains a critical component of a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although supportive clinical signs are often not easily appreciated, particularly in the early symptomatic stages of the disease. Although diagnostic criteria have been developed to facilitate improved detection of lower motor neuron impairment through electrophysiological features that have improved diagnostic sensitivity, assessment of upper motor neuron involvement remains problematic.Recent findingsRecent evidence has emerged about pathophysiological processes, particularly glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, which has resulted in the development of novel diagnostic investigations and uncovered potential therapeutic targets. Advances in genetics, including the C9orf72 gene, have changed concepts of ALS, from being classified as a neuromuscular disease to a disease that forms a continuum with other primary neurodegenerative disorders, particularly frontotemporal dementia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been utilized to provide pathophysiological insights, leading to the development of diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers, which are now being introduced into the clinical setting.Specifically, the advent of cortical hyperexcitability has been consistently identified as an early and intrinsic feature of ALS. With greater accessibility of TMS techniques promoting clinical utilization, TMS measures of cortical function may develop as a diagnostic biomarker, with further potential utility in the clinical trial setting for monitoring of neuroprotective and genetic-based therapies.

TI  - Therapeutic Noninvasive Brain Stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a looming public health crisis that currently lacks an effective treatment. Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NBS), particularly transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), offers a promising alternative approach to pharmacological interventions for an increasing number of neurological and psychiatric conditions. The aim of this review is summarize data from therapeutic trials of NBS in AD and other dementing illnesses.
   Despite the potential of NBS, there is limited theoretical framework and a lack of guidelines for its applications to AD. Several published clinical trials failed to report key parameters of the interventions thus limiting the utility of the study to assess efficacy and safety. Our review concludes with some suggestions for future studies aimed to advance research into NBS as a potential treatment for the symptoms and disabilities caused by AD and to enable comparison of results across trials. Ultimately, appropriately powered, and controlled, multi-site randomized clinical trials will be needed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of NBS in AD.

TI  - TMS as a Tool for Examining Cognitive Processing
T2  - CURRENT NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE REPORTS
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method where an externally placed, rapidly changing magnetic field causes induction of weak electric currents that lead to changes in neuronal polarization and activity. TMS is a modality that has emerged as a unique tool in the study of functional neuroscience for several reasons. TMS can be used to selectively activate or inhibit specific cortical structures, leading to transient perturbations in their function. Systematic study of these perturbations has been employed to determine the function of specific cortical structures and to investigate structure-function relationships. These studies extend to the functional mapping of brain structures as well as brain networks. While TMS was first validated in studies of motor cortex function, it has been applied to the study of cognition and cognitive processing. "Virtual lesions" can be transiently induced in areas of eloquent cortex that allow for the evaluation of their function in cognition and behavior and can be used to evaluate the modes and hierarchy of control of these functions. When TMS is delivered in a repetitive fashion, long-term alterations of cortical function are induced which can be used to study functional brain plasticity, and the changes in brain plasticity in different cognitive states, including aging and diseases involving cognition. Furthermore, repetitive TMS strategies have been developed as possible modulators of cognitive function, with potential to serve as cognitive enhancers in both healthy and disease states. In this review, specific attention is given to the use of TMS in the evaluation of neurophysiologic changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as the potential role of TMS as a cognitive enhancing therapy in AD.

TI  - Non-dopaminergic treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson's disease: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
CP  - International Symposium on Dementia in Parkinson's Disease
AB  - Objective: To review the clinical management of cognitive impairment and dementia related to Parkinson's disease (PD), with emphasis on pharmacologic intervention strategies such as cholinesterase inhibitors. Data sources: A MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and Cochrane Collaboration search of English language literature from 1970 to 2004 was performed to identify reviews, studies, case reports, and letters pertaining to the treatment of cognitive impairment in PD. The bibliographies of selected articles were reviewed for additional references. Study selection: Human studies or case reports in adults with PD describing the use of drug and other therapies for the treatment of cognitive impairment in PD. Data extraction: Studies were reviewed for study design, number of subjects, outcome measures, dosage, side-effects, particularly, worsening of PD motor symptoms. Conclusion: The strongest evidence for the pharmacological treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia in PD supports the use of cholinesterase inhibitors. Evidence for the efficacy and safety of other agents in PD dementia is either insufficient or inconclusive, but offers intriguing clues for potential future treatments. No reports from the Cochrane Collaboration were found. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cognitive Impairment and Celiac Disease: Is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation a <i>Trait d'Union</i> between Gut and Brain?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Celiac disease is a systemic disorder with multifactorial pathogenesis and multifaceted symptomatology. In response to gluten exposure, a significant part of the general population produces antibodies that have been hypothesized to be deleterious to the brain. Among the well-known neurological manifestations, adult celiac patients often complain cognitive symptoms, ranging from the so-called brain fog till an overt dementia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can contribute to the assessment and monitoring of celiac patients, even in those without a clear neurological involvement. The studies here reviewed seem to converge on an impaired central motor conductivity and a hyperexcitable celiac brain to TMS, which partially reverts back after a long-term gluten restriction. Notably, a clear hyperexcitability is a stably reported feature of both degenerative and vascular dementia. Therefore, given its potential neuroprotective effect, the gluten-free diet should be introduced as early as possible, although the overall response of neurological symptoms (and cognition in particular) is still controversial. Identifying new and possibly modifiable risk factors may be of crucial importance for patients, clinicians, and researchers.

TI  - Non-invasive Brain Stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment-A State-of-the-Art Review on Methodological Characteristics and Stimulation Parameters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background:Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been proposed as a new therapeutic way to enhance the cognition of patients with dementia. However, serious methodological limitations appear to affect the estimates of their efficacy. We reviewed the stimulation parameters and methods of studies that used TMS or tDCS to alleviate the cognitive symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Moreover, we evaluated the risk of bias in these studies. Our aim was to highlight the current vulnerabilities of the field and to formulate recommendations on how to manage these issues when designing studies. Methods:Electronic databases and citation searching were used to identify studies administering TMS or tDCS on patients with AD or MCI to enhance cognitive function. Data were extracted by one review author into summary tables with the supervision of the authors. The risk of bias analysis of randomized-controlled trials was conducted by two independent assessors with version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Results:Overall, 36 trials were identified of which 23 randomized-controlled trials underwent a risk of bias assessment. More than 75% of randomized-controlled trials involved some levels of bias in at least one domain. Stimulation parameters were highly variable with some ranges of effectiveness emerging. Studies with low risk of bias indicated TMS to be potentially effective for patients with AD or MCI while questioned the efficacy of tDCS. Conclusions:The presence and extent of methodical issues affecting TMS and tDCS research involving patients with AD and MCI were examined for the first time. The risk of bias frequently affected the domains of the randomization process and selection of the reported data while missing outcome was rare. Unclear reporting was present involving randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. Methodological awareness can potentially reduce the high variability of the estimates regarding the effectiveness of TMS and tDCS. Studies with low risk of bias delineate a range within TMS parameters seem to be effective but question the efficacy of tDCS.

TI  - Consensus paper: Combining transcranial stimulation with neuroimaging
T2  - BRAIN STIMULATION
AB  - In the last decade, combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-neuroimaging studies have greatly stimulated research in the field of TMS and neuroimaging. Here, we review how TMS can be combined with various neuroimaging techniques to investigate human brain function. When applied during neuroimaging (online approach), TMS can be used to test how focal cortex stimulation acutely modifies the activity and connectivity in the stimulated neuronal circuits. TMS and neuroimaging can also be separated in time (offline approach). A conditioning session of repetitive TMS (rTMS) may be used to induce rapid reorganization in functional brain networks. The temporospatial patterns of TMS-induced reorganization can be subsequently mapped by using neuroimaging methods. Alternatively, neuroimaging may be performed first to localize brain areas that are involved in a given task. The temporospatial information obtained by neuroimaging can be used to define the optimal site and time point of stimulation in a subsequent experiment in which TMS is used to probe the functional contribution of the stimulated area. to a specific task. In this review, we first address some general methodologic issues that need to be taken into account when using TMS in the context of neuroimaging. We then discuss the use of specific brain mapping techniques in conjunction with TMS. We emphasize that the various neuroimaging techniques offer complementary information and have different methodologic strengths and weaknesses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cognitive and Neuropathophysiological Outcomes of Gamma-tACS in Dementia: A Systematic Review
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
AB  - Despite the numerous pharmacological interventions targeting dementia, no disease-modifying therapy is available, and the prognosis remains unfavorable. A promising perspective involves tackling high-frequency gamma-band (> 30 Hz) oscillations involved in hippocampal-mediated memory processes, which are impaired from the early stages of typical Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Particularly, the positive effects of gamma-band entrainment on mouse models of AD have prompted researchers to translate such findings into humans using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a methodology that allows the entrainment of endogenous cortical oscillations in a frequency-specific manner. This systematic review examines the state-of-the-art on the use of gamma-tACS in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia patients to shed light on its feasibility, therapeutic impact, and clinical effectiveness. A systematic search from two databases yielded 499 records resulting in 10 included studies and a total of 273 patients. The results were arranged in single-session and multi-session protocols. Most of the studies demonstrated cognitive improvement following gamma-tACS, and some studies showed promising effects of gamma-tACS on neuropathological markers, suggesting the feasibility of gamma-tACS in these patients anyhow far from the strong evidence available for mouse models. Nonetheless, the small number of studies and their wide variability in terms of aims, parameters, and measures, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions. We discuss results and methodological limitations of the studies, proposing possible solutions and future avenues to improve research on the effects of gamma-tACS on dementia.

TI  - Present and future of the transcranial magnetic stimulation
T2  - INVESTIGACION CLINICA
AB  - Magnetic stimulation has called the attention of neuroscientists and the public due to the possibility to stimulate and "control" the nervous system in a non-invasive way. It has helped to make more accurate diagnosis, and apply more effective treatments and rehabilitation protocols in several diseases that affect the nervous system. Likewise, this novel tool has increased our knowledge about complex neural behavior, its connections as well as its plastic modulation. Magnetic stimulation applied in simple or paired-pulse protocols is a useful alternative in the diagnosis of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, epilepsy, dystonia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebrovascular disease, and sleep disorders. From the therapeutic perspective, magnetic stimulation applied repetitively has been found useful, with different degrees of efficacy, in treating resistant depression, tinnitus, psychogenic dysphonia, Alzheimer disease, autism, Parkinson disease, dystonia, stroke, epilepsy, generalized anxiety as well as post traumatic stress disorder, auditory hallucinations, chronic pain, aphasias, obsessive-compulsive disorders, L-dopa induced dyskynesia, mania and Rasmussen syndrome, among others. The potential of magnetic stimulation in neurorehabilitation is outstanding, with excellent range of safety and, in practical terms, without side effects.

TI  - A Scoping Review of Neuromodulation Techniques in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Useful Tool for Clinical Practice?
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
AB  - Background and Objectives: Neurodegenerative diseases that typically affect the elderly such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia are typically characterised by significant cognitive impairment that worsens significantly over time. To date, viable pharmacological options for the cognitive symptoms in these clinical conditions are lacking. In recent years, various studies have employed neuromodulation techniques to try and contrast patients' decay. Materials and Methods: We conducted an in-depth literature review of the state-of-the-art of the contribution of these techniques across these neurodegenerative diseases. Results: The present review reports that neuromodulation techniques targeting cognitive impairment do not allow to draw yet any definitive conclusion about their clinical efficacy although preliminary evidence is very encouraging. Conclusions: Further and more robust studies should evaluate the potentialities and limitations of the application of these promising therapeutic tools to neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - We carried out a systematic study of bibliographical review of scientific evidence provided by clinical trials that assessed the short, medium and long-term efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)from 1965 until June 2003. The studies with the following features have been excluded: a) those in which ECT is not the aim of the research; b) those that do not compare ECT with another different treatment; c) those in which the aim of the research is not to evaluate the efficacy of ECT, and d) those in which the studies are not randomized clinical trials. We have used the biomedical databases Medline, Psyclit, IMF and Cochrane. On applying the corresponding search strategies on every bibliographical repertory, a total amount of 916 studies were found, which were reduced to 62 after having applied the specified exclusion criteria. The scientific evidence obtained, which compare the efficacy of ECT exclusively in depression, schizophrenia, mania and Parkinson disease, are systematized.

TI  - On the Use of TMS to Investigate the Pathophysiology of Neurodegenerative Diseases
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are a collection of disorders that result in the progressive degeneration and death of neurons. They are clinically heterogenous and can present as deficits in movement, cognition, executive function, memory, visuospatial awareness and language. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation tool that allows for the assessment of cortical function in vivo. We review how TMS has been used for the investigation of three neurodegenerative diseases that differ in their neuroanatomical axes: (1) Motor cortex-corticospinal tract (motor neuron diseases), (2) Non-motor cortical areas (dementias), and (3) Subcortical structures (parkinsonisms). We also make four recommendations that we hope will benefit the use of TMS in neurodegenerative diseases. Firstly, TMS has traditionally been limited by the lack of an objective output and so has been confined to stimulation of the motor cortex; this limitation can be overcome by the use of concurrent neuroimaging methods such as EEG. Given that neurodegenerative diseases progress over time, TMS measures should aim to track longitudinal changes, especially when the aim of the study is to look at disease progression and symptomatology. The lack of gold-standard diagnostic confirmation undermines the validity of findings in clinical populations. Consequently, diagnostic certainty should be maximized through a variety of methods including multiple, independent clinical assessments, imaging and fluids biomarkers, and post-mortem pathological confirmation where possible. There is great interest in understanding the mechanisms by which symptoms arise in neurodegenerative disorders. However, TMS assessments in patients are usually carried out during resting conditions, when the brain network engaged during these symptoms is not expressed. Rather, a context-appropriate form of TMS would be more suitable in probing the physiology driving clinical symptoms. In all, we hope that the recommendations made here will help to further understand the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease and the impact of physical exercise with advancements in therapeutic approaches
T2  - AIMS NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common, severe neurodegenerative brain disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles in the brain causing neural disintegration, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death leading to dementia. Although many US-FDA-approved drugs like Donepezil, Rivastigmine, Galantamine are available in the market, their consumption reduces only the symptoms of the disease but fails in potency to cure the disease. This disease affects many individuals with aging. Combating the disease tends to be very expensive. This review focuses on biochemical mechanisms in the neuron both at normal and AD state with relevance to the tau hypothesis, amyloid hypothesis, the risk factors influencing dementia, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation altogether integrated with neurodegeneration. A brief survey is carried out on available biomarkers in the diagnosis of the disease, drugs used for the treatment, and the challenges in approaching therapeutic targets in inhibiting the disease pathologies. This review conjointly assesses the demerits with the inefficiency of drugs to reach targets, their side effects, and toxicity. Optimistically, this review directs on the advantageous strategies in using nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems to cross the blood-brain barrier for improving the efficacy of drugs combined with a novel neuronal stem cell therapy approach. Determinately, this review aims at the natural, non-therapeutic healing impact of physical exercise on different model organisms and the effect of safe neuromodulation treatments using repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) in humans to control the disease pathologies prominent in enhancing the synaptic function.

TI  - Neuroplasticity in Alzheimer's disease: a therapeutic alternative at the molecular level
T2  - MEDISUR-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS MEDICAS DE CIENFUEGOS
AB  - The neuroplasticity mechanisms of the organism form the basis of dissimilar therapies that seek to potentiate such effects to achieve relative improvement in a large number of neurodegenerative diseases. Included within this high number of conditions, Alzheimer's disease stands out, due to its direct relationship with the alarming figures of population aging in Cuba and the world. The objective of this bibliographic review was to describe the main therapeutic alternatives that are based on the neuroplasticity mechanism, applicable in patients with Alzheimer's disease. For this, a literature review was carried out, and relevant publications from the last five years were identified. It was concluded that, according to the strongest evidence found, the fundamental therapeutic alternatives are those focused on enhancing neuronal plasticity; standing out within this group of therapies, physical exercise, transcranial magnetic stimulation and increased concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Especially notable the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, due to its demonstrated ability to promote neuronal plasticity through different ways.

TI  - Cortico-cortical connectivity: the road from basic neurophysiological interactions to therapeutic applications
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) based methods are emerging as a unique approach to evaluate in real-time brain electrical activity in healthy and pathological conditions. By applying TMS pulses in two different bran areas within a short temporal frame of few milliseconds, it is possible to investigate their physiological interactions. These paradigms, collectively termed dual-site TMS, have been inspired by Professor John Rothwell's work, based on the idea that applying a conditioning stimulus over a cortical area may activate putative pathways projecting onto a second target area, thus providing a unique opportunity to test the causal effects between interconnected brain areas. This review highlights the most important features of dual-coil TMS protocols, mainly pioneered in Professor John Rothwell's lab. In the first part, I reviewed development of dual-site TMS protocols leading to the discovery of a distributed system of short-latency interactions within the human parieto-frontal network, likely mediated by direct anatomical pathways. In the second part, the physiological role of these dual-site TMS evoked pathways is considered, describing how these functional interactions are not fixed but vary depending on the brain activation, the condition and on the precise time window in which they are explored. Then, I reviewed recent advances showing that the repeated coupling of interconnected neuronal populations, by means of dual-coil TMS, is able to induce spike-time-dependent plasticity and to determine selective potentiation of physiological connectivity between two human brain regions. Finally, the therapeutic implications of these novel discoveries are discussed, pointing to multi-site TMS as a novel tool to identify early features of synaptic dysfunctions, to monitor disease progression and potentially to provide novel therapeutic approaches by reshaping plasticity in different neurological and psychiatric conditions.

The evidence for nonpharmacological therapies in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias has been studied systematically, but the evidence is unclear for their efficacy in cognition and dementia in PD. An international collaboration produced a comprehensive, systematic review of the effectiveness and of nonpharmacological and noninvasive therapies in cognitively intact, cognitively impaired, and PD dementia groups. The interventions included cognitive rehabilitation, physical rehabilitation, exercise, and brain stimulation techniques but excluded invasive treatments, such as surgery and deep brain stimulation. The potential biases and evidence levels for controlled trials (CTs) were analyzed based on Cochrane and National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence criteria. After exclusions, 18 studies were reviewed, including 5 studies of cognitive training, 4 of exercise and physical therapies, 4 of combined cognitive and physical interventions, and 5 of brain stimulation techniques. The methodology, study populations, interventions, outcomes, control groups, analyses, results, limitations, biases, and evidence levels of all reviewed studies were described. There were 9 CTs, including 6 randomized CTs (RCTs). Although 5 trials showed positive results, only 1 study of cognitive training achieved evidence grading of 1+ with a low risk of bias. There were no studies on PD dementia. Current research on nonpharmacological therapies for cognitive dysfunction and dementia in PD is very limited in quantity and quality. There is an urgent need for rigorous RCTs of nonpharmacological treatments for cognitive impairment and dementia in PD. (c) 2013 Movement Disorder Society

TI  - Effectiveness of language training and non-invasive brain stimulation on oral and written naming performance in Primary Progressive Aphasia: A meta-analysis and systematic review
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the efficacy of language training, alone or in combination with non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, designed to improve oral and written naming abilities in Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA), and to investigate whether gains can be maintained over time and generalize to untrained items. An electronic database search was conducted up to 31st of May 2019. Forty-three articles on language training alone and seven articles on the combined treatment fitted the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Results indicated that language training, alone or in combination with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), improves oral naming accuracy for trained items in patients with PPA, with a long-term maintenance of the gain over time. Only language training combined with tDCS improves oral naming accuracy for untrained items. Considering written naming abilities, language training combined with tDCS improves performance for both trained and untrained items, immediately after training and at follow-up.

TI  - Non-invasive brain stimulation and language processing in the healthy brain
T2  - APHASIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been used as a probe to modulate cognitive functions in humans for the last 20 years. The two most commonly reported techniques are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which have both been used with different stimulation parameters to increase or decrease excitability in target cortical regions.
   Aims: In the present review, we highlight recent developments in TMS and tDCS in language research in healthy individuals.
   Main Contribution: We will first describe how tDCS and TMS have been employed to improve either performance of language tasks, or learning in the language domain (facilitatory brain stimulation). Then, we will show how these techniques were used as interference techniques (inhibitory brain stimulation) for understanding brain-behaviour interactions and to explore possible cause-effect links between altered activity in specific brain areas and particular behaviours. We will only review studies in healthy individuals, and first pilot trials in patient population with more general cognitive impairments (idiopathic Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease). For tDCS studies in aphasia, see Holland and Crinion (2012); for TMS studies in aphasia, see Medina et al. (2012).
   Conclusions: In the healthy brain, NIBS can be used to delineate the functional significance of a particular brain region for the respective language task under study. Here, new possibilities of combining TMS or tDCS with functional imaging techniques offer unique opportunities to not only address the functional significance of a brain area underlying the coil or electrode, but in addition allow testing NIBS effects on an entire network. In this setting, TMS, both in its single-pulse and its repetitive form, allows the modulation of a specific function within milliseconds (single-pulse) or the order of seconds (particularly high-frequency rTMS trains), while tDCS has the disadvantage of requiring longer stimulation times. On the other hand, the relatively easy use of tDCS in the magnetic resonance scanner environment will render simultaneous recording of brain function and activation much more accessible, thus offering novel avenues in the study of network effects of NIBS. For proof-of principle studies to improve language learning in the healthy brain, tDCS may be the most fruitful approach due to its easy applicability and excellent safety profile. Subsequent use of this technique in parallel to training protocols to improve re-acquisition of language functions aphasic patients offers exciting possibilities in the realm of neurorehabilitation.

TI  - Neurophysiology and neurochemistry of corticobasal syndrome
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Corticobasal syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disorder, which presents with a progressive, asymmetrical, akinetic rigid syndrome and early cortical signs. However, clinical, pathological, and electrophysiological heterogeneity makes the understanding of this syndrome challenging. Corticobasal syndrome can have various pathological substrates including corticobasal degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, Fronto-temporal degeneration with TDP inclusions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Furthermore, tools such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional neuroimaging techniques like PET and SPECT have not been adequately used to supplement the clinico-pathological heterogeneity. TMS studies in CBS have revealed changes in cortical excitability and transcortical inhibition. Despite the availability of more than 2 decades, its potential in CBS has not been fully utilized in studying the cortical plasticity and effect of Levodopa on central neurophysiology. PET and SPECT studies in CBS have shown abnormalities in regional glucose metabolism, asymmetrical involvement of presynaptic dopaminergic system, and ascending cholinergic connections to the cortex. While most studies have shown normal D2 receptor-binding activity in striatum of CBS cases, the results have not been unanimous. Functional neuroimaging and TMS studies in CBS have shown the involvement of GABAergic, muscarinic, and dopaminergic systems. In this review, we aim to provide the current state of understanding of central neurophysiology and neurochemistry of CBS using TMS and functional neuroimaging techniques. We also highlight the heterogeneous nature of this disorder and the existing knowledge gaps.

TI  - Decoding the radiomic features of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in individuals with accelerated cortical changes: implications for personalized transcranial magnetic stimulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING
AB  - Purpose Image-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an emerging research field in neuroscience and rehabilitation medicine. Cortical morphometry, as a radiomic phenotype of aging, plays a vital role in developing personalized TMS model, yet few studies are afoot to examine the aging effects on region-specific morphometry and use it in the estimation of TMS-induced electric fields. Our study was aimed to investigate the radiomic features of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and quantify the TMS-induced electric fields during aging.Approach Baseline, 1-year and 3-year structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from normal aging (NA) adults (n = 32) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) converters (n = 22) were drawn from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies. The quantitative measures of radiomics included cortical thickness, folding, and scalp-to-cortex distance. Realistic head models were developed to simulate the impacts of radiomic features on TMS-induced E-fields using the finite-element method.Results A pronounced aging-related decrease was found in the gyrification of left DLPFC in MCI converters (t = 2.21, p = 0.035), which could predict the decline of global cognition at 3-year follow up. Along with the decreased gyrification in left DLPFC, the magnitude of TMS-induced E-fields was rapidly decreased in MCI converters (t = 2.56, p = 0.018).Conclusions MRI-informed radiomic features of the treatment targets have significant effects on the intensity and distribution of the stimulation-induced electric fields in prodromal dementia patients. Our findings highlight the importance of region-specific radiomics when conducting the transcranial brain stimulation in individuals with accelerated cortical changes, such as Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Application of transcranial brain stimulation in dementia
T2  - TZU CHI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - The number of patients with dementia grows rapidly as the global population ages, which posits tremendous health-care burden to the society. Only cholinesterase inhibitors and a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist have been approved for treating patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and their clinical effects remained limited. Medical devices serve as an alternative therapeutic approach to modulating neural activities and enhancing cognitive function. Four major brain stimulation technologies including deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) have been applied to AD in a clinical trial setting. DBS allows electrical stimulation at the specified nucleus but remains resource-demanding, and after all, an invasive surgery; whereas TMS and tDCS are widely available and affordable but less ideal with respect to localization. The unique physical property of TUS, on the other hand, allows both thermal and mechanical energy to be transduced and focused for neuromodulation. In the context of dementia, using focused ultrasound to induce blood-brain barrier opening for delivering drugs and metabolizing amyloid protein has drawn great attention in recent years. Furthermore, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound has demonstrated its neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies, leading to ongoing clinical trials for AD. The potential and limitation of transcranial brain stimulation for treating patients with dementia would be discussed in this review.

TI  - Electroencephalographic hallmarks of Alzheimer?s disease
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - In the human brain, physiological aging is characterized by progressive neuronal loss, leading to disruption of synapses and to a degree of failure in neurotransmission and information flow. However, there is increasing evidence to support the notion that the aged brain has a remarkable level of resilience (i.s. ability to reorganize itself), with the aim of preserving its physiological activity. It is therefore of paramount interest to develop objective markers able to characterize the biological processes underlying brain aging in the intact human, and to distinguish them from brain degeneration associated to age-related neurological progressive diseases like Alzheimer's disease. EEG, alone and combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS-EEG), is particularly suited to this aim, due to the functional nature of the information provided, and thanks to the ease with which it can be integrated in ecological scenarios including behavioral tasks. In this review, we aimed to provide the reader with updated information about the role of modern methods of EEG and TMS-EEG analysis in the investigation of physiological brain aging and Alzheimer's disease. In particular, we focused on data about cortical connectivity obtained by using readouts such graph theory network brain organization and architecture, and transcranial evoked potentials (TEPs) during TMS-EEG. Overall, findings in the literature support an important potential contribution of such neurophysiological techniques to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying normal brain aging and the early (prodromal/pre-symptomatic) stages of dementia.

TI  - Non-Invasive Neuromodulation Methods to Alleviate Symptoms of Huntington's Disease: A Systematic Review of the Literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disease. There is growing evidence for non-invasive neuromodulation tools as therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative diseases. This systematic review aims to investigate the effectiveness of noninvasive neuromodulation in HD-associated motor, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, Embase, and PsycINFO from inception to 13 July 2021. Case reports, case series, and clinical trials were included while screening/diagnostic tests involving non-invasive neuromodulation, review papers, experimental studies on animal models, other systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were excluded. We have identified 19 studies in the literature investigating the use of ECT, TMS, and tDCS in the treatment of HD. Quality assessments were performed using Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI's) critical appraisal tools. Eighteen studies showed improvement of HD symptoms, but the results were very heterogeneous considering different intervention techniques and protocols, and domains of symptoms. The most noticeable improvement involved depression and psychosis after ECT protocols. The impact on cognitive and motor symptoms is more controversial. Further investigations are required to determine the therapeutic role of distinct neuromodulation techniques for HD-related symptoms.

TI  - Intermittent theta burst stimulation of cerebellar vermis enhances fronto-cerebellar resting state functional connectivity in schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
AB  - Objective: Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are substantially disabling and treatment resistant. Novel treat-ments like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) need to be examined for the same using the experimental medicine approach that incorporates tests of mechanism of action in addition to clinical efficacy in trials.
   Methods: Study was a double-blind, parallel, randomized, sham-controlled trial recruiting schizophrenia with at least a moderate severity of negative symptoms. Participants were randomized to real or sham intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) under MRI-guided neuro-navigation, targeting the cerebellar vermis area VII-B, at a stimulus intensity of 100% active motor threshold, two sessions/day for five days (total = 6000 pulses). Assessments were conducted at baseline (T0), day-6 (T1) and week-6 (T2) after initiation of intervention. Main outcomes were, a) Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) score (T0, T1, T2), b) fronto-cerebellar resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) (T0, T1).
   Results: Thirty participants were recruited in each arm. Negative symptoms improved in both arms (p < 0.001) but was not significantly different between the two arms (p = 0.602). RSFC significantly increased between the cerebellar vermis and the right inferior frontal gyrus (p(cluster-FWER) = 0.033), right pallidum (p(cluster-FWER) = 0.042) and right frontal pole (p(cluster-FWER) = 0.047) in the real arm with no change in the sham arm.
   Conclusion: Cerebellar vermal iTBS engaged a target belonging to the class of cerebello-subcortical-cortical networks, implicated in negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, this did not translate to a superior clinical efficacy. Future trials should employ enhanced midline cerebellar TMS stimulation parameters for longer durations that can potentiate and translate biological changes into clinical effects.

TI  - The modulation effect of non-invasive brain stimulation on cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
T2  - BMC NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - BackgroundTo prevent and control dementia, many scholars have focused on the transition stage between normal ageing and dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which is a key interventional target for dementia. Studies have shown that non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is beneficial to improve cognitive function of MCI patients. However, whether NIBS is conducive to the protection of cognitive ability in MCI patients remains unknown due to limited evidence. The aim of the study was to systematically evaluate the modulation effect of NIBS on cognitive function (global cognitive ability and specific domains of cognition) in patients with MCI.ResultsA total of 11 RCTs comprising a total of 367 MCI participants. Meta-analysis showed that NIBS can significantly improve global cognition (n=271, SMD=0.94, 95% CI 0.47-1.41, p<0.0001) and verbal fluency (n=72, MD=2.03, 95% CI 0.17-3.88, p=0.03). However, there was no significant improvement in other domains of cognition.ConclusionsNIBS has a positive effect on improving global cognitive function and verbal fluency. At the same time, it has a small positive effect on improving executive function. However, these findings should be interpreted carefully due to the limitations of the study.

TI  - Cortical Plasticity in Depression: A Neurochemical Perspective From Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
T2  - ASN NEURO
AB  - Neural plasticity is considered the neurophysiological correlate of learning and memory, although several studies have also noted that it plays crucial roles in a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Indeed, impaired brain plasticity may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlies both cognitive decline and major depression. Moreover, a degree of cognitive impairment is frequently observed throughout the clinical spectrum of mood disorders, and the relationship between depression and cognition is often bidirectional. However, most evidence for dysfunctional neural plasticity in depression has been indirect. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has emerged as a noninvasive tool for investigating several parameters of cortical excitability with the aim of exploring the functions of different neurotransmission pathways and for probing invivo plasticity in both healthy humans and those with pathological conditions. In particular, depressed patients exhibit a significant interhemispheric difference in motor cortex excitability, an imbalanced inhibitory or excitatory intracortical neurochemical circuitry, reduced postexercise facilitation, and an impaired long-term potentiation-like response to paired-associative transcranial magnetic stimulation, and these symptoms may indicate disrupted plasticity. Research aimed at disentangling the mechanism by which neuroplasticity plays a role in the pathological processes that lead to depression and evaluating the effects of modulating neuroplasticity are needed for the field to facilitate more powerful translational research studies and identify novel therapeutic targets.

TI  - The Efficacy of Combining Cognitive Training and Noninvasive Brain Stimulation: A Transdiagnostic Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN
AB  - Over the past decade, an increasing number of studies investigated the innovative approach of supplementing cognitive training (CT) with noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to increase the effects on outcomes. In this review, we aim to summarize the evidence for this treatment combination. We identified 72 published and unpublished studies (reporting 773 effect sizes), including 2,518 participants from healthy and clinical populations indexed in PubMed, MEDLINE, APA PsycInfo, ProQuest, Web of Science, and https://ClinicalTrials.gov (last search: August 9, 2022) that compared the effects of NIBS combined with CT on cognitive, symptoms, and everyday functioning to CT alone at postintervention and/or follow-up. We performed random-effects meta-analyses with robust variance estimation and assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane ROB tool. Only four studies had low risk of bias in all domains, and many studies lacked standard controls such as keeping the outcome assessor and trainer unaware of the treatment condition. Following sensitivity analyses, only learning/memory robustly improved significantly more when CT was combined with NIBS compared to CT only (g = 0.18, 95% CI [0.07, 0.29]) at postintervention, but not in the long term. The effect was small and limited by substantial heterogeneity. The other seven cognitive outcome domains, symptoms, and everyday functioning did not benefit from adding NIBS to CT. Given the methodological limitation of prior studies, more high-quality trials that focus on the potential of combining NIBS and CT to enhance benefits in everyday functioning in the short and long term are needed to evaluate whether combining NIBS and CT is relevant for clinical practice.

TI  - Enhancement of neural regeneration as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (Review)
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia worldwide, has gradually become a global health concern for society and individuals with the process of global ageing. Although extensive research has been carried out on AD, the etiology and pathological mechanism of the disease are still unclear, and there is no specific drug to cure or delay AD progression. The exploration of enhancing nerve regeneration in AD has gradually attracted increasing attention. In the current review, the existing therapeutic strategies were summarized to induce nerve regeneration which can increase the number of neurons, and improve the survival of neurons, the plasticity of synapses and synaptic activity. The strategies include increasing neurotrophic expression (such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor), inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (such as donepezil, tacrine, rivastigmine and galanthamine), elevating histone deacetylase levels (such as RGFP-966, Tasquinimod, CM-414 and 44B), stimulating the brain by physiotherapy (such as near-infrared light, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation) and transplanting exogenous neural stem cells. However, further evaluations need to be performed to determine the optimal treatment. The present study reviews recent interventions for enhancing adult neurogenesis and attempts to elucidate their mechanisms of action, which may provide a theoretical basis for inducing nerve regeneration to fight against AD.

TI  - Can brain stimulation enhance cognition in clinical populations? A critical review
T2  - RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Many psychiatric and neurological conditions are associated with cognitive impairment for which there are very limited treatment options. Brain stimulation methodologies show promise as novel therapeutics and have cognitive effects. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), known more for its related transient adverse cognitive effects, can produce significant cognitive improvement in the weeks following acute treatment. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is increasingly used as a treatment for major depression and has acute cognitive effects. Emerging research from controlled studies suggests that repeated TMS treatments may additionally have cognitive benefit. ECT and TMS treatment cause neurotrophic changes, although whether these are associated with cognitive effects remains unclear. Transcranial electrical stimulation methods including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) are in development as novel treatments for multiple psychiatric conditions. These treatments may also produce cognitive enhancement particularly when stimulation occurs concurrently with a cognitive task. This review summarizes the current clinical evidence for these brain stimulation treatments as therapeutics for enhancing cognition. Acute, or short-lasting, effects as well as longer-term effects from repeated treatments are reviewed, together with potential putative neural mechanisms. Areas of future research are highlighted to assist with optimization of these approaches for enhancing cognition.

TI  - Non-invasive brain stimulation to assess and modulate neuroplasticity in Alzheimer's disease
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative and progressive disease related to a gradual decline in cognitive functions such as memory, attention, perceptual-spatial abilities, language, and executive functions. Recent evidence has suggested that interventions promoting neural plasticity can induce significant cognitive gains especially in subjects at risk of or with mild AD. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are non-invasive techniques that can induce significant and long-lasting changes in focal and non-focal neuroplasticity. In this review, we present initial preliminary evidence that TMS and tDCS can enhance performance in cognitive functions typically impaired in AD. Also, we reviewed the initial six studies on AD that presented early findings showing cognitive gains such as in recognition memory and language associated with TMS and tDCS treatment. In addition, we showed that TMS has also been used to assess neuroplasticity changes in AD supporting the notion that cortical excitability is changed in AD due to the neurodegenerative process. Due to the safe profile, cost of these tools, and initial clinical trials results, further studies are warranted in order to replicate and extend the initial findings of rTMS and tDCS as cognitive enhancers in AD. Further trials should explore different targets of stimulation along with different paradigms of stimulation including combination with behavioural interventions.

TI  - The effect of nonpharmacologic therapy on global cognitive functions in patients with Alzheimer's disease: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: The effectiveness of non-pharmacologic therapy (NPT) in treating the global cognition dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been clearly demonstrated. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to address this issue. Methods: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PUBMED, EMBASE and other databases were searched, and outcomes measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) were analysed. Results: Seven types of NPT were included, 25 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected and 3238 participants were included in the meta-analysis. There were significant differences between the NPT and control groups in the MMSE and ADAS-cog scores. Conclusions: Although more extensive trials need to be performed, NPT has been observed to be beneficial in AD patients.

TI  - Efficacy of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) on post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI): a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - BackgroundStroke is a significant global cause of mortality and morbidity, and post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) affects up to half of stroke patients. Despite the availability of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, there is a lack of definitive effective treatments for PSCI. Non-invasive brain stimulation, particularly intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), has emerged as a promising therapy for the treatment of PSCI.ObjectiveThis systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iTBS in enhancing cognitive function among patients with PSCI.MethodsA comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and CNKI, to identify relevant randomized controlled trials published before April 2023. The primary outcome measured changes in global cognitive scales, while the secondary outcomes focused on improvements in attention, orientation, visual-spatial perception, and activities of daily living.ResultsThe meta-analysis encompassed six studies involving 325 patients. The results demonstrated that iTBS led to a significant improvement in global cognitive scales (SMD = 1.12, 95% CI = [0.59 to 1.65], P < 0.0001), attention (SMD = 0.48, 95% CI [0.13 to 0.82], P = 0.007), visual perception (SMD = 0.99, 95% CI [0.13 to 1.86], P = 0.02), and activities of daily living (SMD = 0.82, 95% CI [0.55 to 1.08], P < 0.00001). However, there was no significant effect on orientation (SMD = 0.36, 95% CI [- 0.04 to 0.76], P = 0.07). Subgroup analysis based on the number of sessions was conducted, revealing a significant improvement in global cognition among patients with PSCI across the three categories (10 sessions, 20 sessions, and 30 sessions) with no between-group difference (P = 0.28). None of the included studies reported any serious adverse effects.ConclusionIn conclusion, iTBS appears to be a safe and effective non-invasive treatment that can enhance the cognitive abilities and daily living skills of patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment. However, our conclusion is constrained by the limited number of studies. Further high-quality, large-sample RCTs with extended follow-up periods are necessary to validate these findings. Integrating iTBS with brain imaging techniques, such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance, could aid in understanding the mechanism of iTBS action.

TI  - Past, Present, and Future of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation Approaches to Treat Cognitive Impairment in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Time for a Comprehensive Critical Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Low birth rates and increasing life expectancy experienced by developed societies have placed an unprecedented pressure on governments and the health system to deal effectively with the human, social and financial burden associated to aging-related diseases. At present, similar to 24 million people worldwide suffer from cognitive neurodegenerative diseases, a prevalence that doubles every five years. Pharmacological therapies and cognitive training/rehabilitation have generated temporary hope and, occasionally, proof of mild relief. Nonetheless, these approaches are yet to demonstrate a meaningful therapeutic impact and changes in prognosis. We here review evidence gathered for nearly a decade on non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), a less known therapeutic strategy aiming to limit cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation, two of the most popular NIBS technologies, use electrical fields generated non-invasively in the brain to long-lastingly enhance the excitability/activity of key brain regions contributing to relevant cognitive processes. The current comprehensive critical review presents proof-of-concept evidence and meaningful cognitive outcomes of NIBS in eight of the most prevalent neurodegenerative pathologies affecting cognition: Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Primary Progressive Aphasias (PPA), behavioral variant of Frontotemporal Dementia, Corticobasal Syndrome, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and Posterior Cortical Atrophy. We analyzed a total of 70 internationally published studies: 33 focusing on Alzheimer's disease, 19 on PPA and 18 on the remaining neurodegenerative pathologies. The therapeutic benefit and clinical significance of NIBS remains inconclusive, in particular given the lack of a sufficient number of double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials using multiday stimulation regimes, the heterogeneity of the protocols, and adequate behavioral and neuroimaging response biomarkers, able to show lasting effects and an impact on prognosis. The field remains promising but, to make further progress, research efforts need to take in account the latest evidence of the anatomical and neurophysiological features underlying cognitive deficits in these patient populations. Moreover, as the development of in vivo biomarkers are ongoing, allowing for an early diagnosis of these neuro-cognitive conditions, one could consider a scenario in which NIBS treatment will be personalized and made part of a cognitive rehabilitation program, or useful as a potential adjunct to drug therapies since the earliest stages of suh diseases. Research should also integrate novel knowledge on the mechanisms and constraints guiding the impact of electrical and magnetic fields on cerebral tissues and brain activity, and incorporate the principles of information-based neurostimulation.

TI  - Effects of treadmill training on gait of elders with Parkinson's disease: a literature review
T2  - EINSTEIN-SAO PAULO
AB  - Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in old age. Aging process for elders with Parkinson's disease can induce gait disturbances with more functional disabilities than for elders without the disease. Treadmill training as a therapy has resulted in notable effects on the gait of patients with Parkinson's disease and may be a resource for geriatric neurological rehabilitation. This review aimed to study the effects on gait after treadmill training in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease. The search was performed in the databases PubMed (R), LILACS, PEDro and EMBASE, with the following keywords: "Parkinson's disease", "elderly", "treadmill training" and "gait evaluation". The quality of the studies included was assessed by PEDro Scale. Eleven studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eight studies were randomized, and only one did a follow-up. One can observe in this review that treadmill training with or without weight support (at least 20 minutes, two to three times a week, with progressive increase of loads, for minimum of 6 weeks) in elderly patients with the Parkinson's disease was effective to improve gait. In addition, both were considered safe (since some studies described the use of belts, even in unsupported training) and can be associated with therapies complementary to gait, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, visual cues or anodal transcranial direct current stimulation. Treadmill training in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease is an intervention that improves gait outcomes, but further studies are required for better proofs.

TI  - Neurophysiological evidence of corticospinal tract abnormality in patients with <i>parkin</i> mutations
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Mutations in the parkin gene (PARK2) are the most frequent cause of autosomal recessive early-onset Parkinson disease. We performed a transcranial magnetic stimulation study in four patients with parkin mutations. Two patients had a prolonged central motor conduction time at both upper and lower limb, one only at the arm and one only at the leg. The MEP threshold was increased in one patient for the arm and in two for the leg. The MEP amplitude was reduced in one and central silent period shortened in two. The findings demonstrate corticospinal dysfunction in these patients and suggest that the extent of central nervous system involvement in parkin disease may be wider that hitherto supposed.

TI  - Overview of Meta-Analyses of Five Non-pharmacological Interventions for Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive memory deficits, cognitive decline, and spatial disorientation. Non-pharmacological interventions to treat AD have been reported in many meta-analyses (MAs), but robust conclusions have not been made because of variations in the scope, quality, and findings of these reviews.
   Objective: This work aimed to review existing MAs to provide an overview of existing evidence on the effects of five non-pharmacological interventions in AD patients on three outcomes: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), activities of daily living (ADL), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive section (ADAS-cog).
   Methods: The databases PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science were searched to collect MAs of non-pharmacological interventions for AD. Two reviewers independently conducted literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment. We assessed the quality of MAs with the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 and assessed the evidence quality for significant outcomes using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system.
   Results: We found 10 eligible MAs, which included between three (133 patients) and 15 randomized trials (1,217 patients), and five non-pharmacological interventions, namely, acupuncture therapy (40%), exercise intervention (30%), music therapy (10%), cognitive intervention (10%), and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) (10%). All the included MAs were critically low to low quality by AMSTAR 2. Acupuncture therapy and exercise intervention showed the preliminary potential to improve ADL and MMSE. rTMS and acupuncture therapy show benefits in decreasing ADAS-cog, and there were some evidence of improved MMSE with cognitive intervention. All these outcomes scored very low quality to moderate quality of evidence on the GRADE system.
   Conclusions: Non-pharmacological therapy shows promise for the treatment of AD, but there is still a lack of high-quality evidence. In the future, the quality of the original research needs to be improved, and strictly designed MAs should be carried out following methodological requirements.

TI  - Effects of pharmacological agents, sleep deprivation, hypoxia and transcranial magnetic stimulation on electroencephalographic rhythms in rodents: Towards translational challenge models for drug discovery in Alzheimer's disease
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Different kinds of challenge can alter spontaneous ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms in animal models, thus providing paradigms to evaluate treatment effects in drug discovery. The effects of challenges represented by pharmacological agents, hypoxia, sleep deprivation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on EEG rhythms are here reviewed to build a knowledge platform for innovative translational models for drug discovery in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been reported that antagonists of cholinergic neurotransmission cause synchronisation of spontaneous ongoing EEG rhythms in terms of enhanced power of EEG low frequencies and decreased power of EEG high frequencies. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and serotonergic drugs may restore a normal pattern of EEG desynchronisation. Sleep deprivation and hypoxia challenges have also been reported to elicit abnormal synchronisation of spontaneous ongoing EEG rhythms in rodents. The feasibility and reproducibility of TMS have been demonstrated in rodents but information on a consistent modulation of EEG after TMS manipulation is very limited. Transgenic mice over-expressing human amyloid precursor protein complementary DNAs (cDNAs) harbouring the 'Swedish' mutation and PS-1 cDNAs harbouring the A264E mutation, which recapitulate some of the pathological features of AD, exhibit alterations of spontaneous ongoing EEG rhythms at several low and high frequencies. This does not appear, however, to be a consequence of beta-amyloid deposition in the brain. The present review provides a critical evaluation of changes of spontaneous ongoing EEG rhythms due to the experimental manipulations described above, in order to stimulate the promote more adherent models fitting dynamics in humans.

TI  - The landscape of neurophysiological outcome measures in ALS interventional trials: A systematic review
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: We collated all interventional clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which utilised at least one neurophysiological technique as a primary or secondary outcome measure. By identifying the strengths and limitations of these studies, we aim to guide study design in future trials.Methods: We conducted and reported this systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Eight databases were searched from inception. In total, 703 studies were retrieved for screening and eligibility assessment.Results: Dating back to 1986, 32 eligible interventional clinical trials were identified, recruiting a median of 30 patients per completed trial. The most widely employed neurophysiological techniques were electromyography, motor unit number estimation (including motor unit number index), neurophysiological index and transcranial magnetic stimulation (including resting motor threshold and short-interval intracortical inhibition). Almost 40% of trials reported a positive outcome with respect to at least one neurophysiological measure. The interventions targeted either ion channels, immune mechanisms or neuronal metabolic pathways.Conclusions: Neurophysiology offers many promising biomarkers that can be utilised as outcome measures in interventional clinical trials in ALS. When selecting the most appropriate technique, key considerations include methodological standardisation, target engagement and logistical burden. Significance: Future trial design in ALS would benefit from a standardised, updated and easily accessible repository of neurophysiological outcome measures.(c) 2022 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

TI  - Targeted neurorehabilitation strategies in post-stroke aphasia
T2  - RESTORATIVE NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Aphasia is a debilitating language impairment, affecting millions of people worldwide. About 40% of stroke survivors develop chronic aphasia, resulting in life-long disability.
   Objective: This review examines extrinsic and intrinsic neuromodulation techniques, aimed at enhancing the effects of speech and language therapies in stroke survivors with aphasia.
   Methods: We discuss the available evidence supporting the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and functional MRI (fMRI) real-time neurofeedback in aphasia rehabilitation.
   Results: This review systematically evaluates studies focusing on efficacy and implementation of specialized methods for post-treatment outcome optimization and transfer to functional skills. It considers stimulation target determination and various targeting approaches. The translation of neuromodulation interventions to clinical practice is explored, emphasizing generalization and functional communication. The review also covers real-time fMRI neurofeedback, discussing current evidence for efficacy and essential implementation parameters. Finally, we address future directions for neuromodulation research in aphasia.
   Conclusions: This comprehensive review aims to serve as a resource for a broad audience of researchers and clinicians interested in incorporating neuromodulation for advancing aphasia care.

TI  - The <i>Movement</i> Disorder Society Evidence-Based Medicine Review Update: Treatments for the Non-Motor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease
T2  - MOVEMENT DISORDERS
AB  - The Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Task Force on Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) Review of Treatments for Parkinson's Disease (PD) was first published in 2002 and was updated in 2005 to cover clinical trial data up to January 2004 with the focus on motor symptoms of PD. In this revised version the MDS task force decided it was necessary to extend the review to non-motor symptoms. The objective of this work was to update previous EBM reviews on treatments for PD with a focus on non-motor symptoms. Level-I (randomized controlled trial, RCT) reports of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for the non-motor symptoms of PD, published as full articles in English between January 2002 and December 2010 were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion and ranking followed the original program outline and adhered to EBM methodology. For efficacy conclusions, treatments were designated: efficacious, likely efficacious, unlikely efficacious, non-efficacious, or insufficient evidence. Safety data were catalogued and reviewed. Based on the combined efficacy and safety assessment, Implications for clinical practice were determined using the following designations: clinically useful, possibly useful, investigational, unlikely useful, and not useful. Fifty-four new studies qualified for efficacy review while several other studies covered safety issues. Updated and new efficacy conclusions were made for all indications. The treatments that are efficacious for the management of the different non-motor symptoms are as follows: pramipexole for the treatment of depressive symptoms, clozapine for the treatment of psychosis, rivastigmine for the treatment of dementia, and botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) and BTX-B as well as glycopyrrolate for the treatment of sialorrhea. The practical implications for these treatments, except for glycopyrrolate, are that they are clinically useful. Since there is insufficient evidence of glycopyrrolate for the treatment of sialorrhea exceeding 1 week, the practice implication is that it is possibly useful. The treatments that are likely efficacious for the management of the different non-motor symptoms are as follows: the tricyclic antidepressants nortriptyline and desipramine for the treatment of depression or depressive symptoms and macrogol for the treatment of constipation. The practice implications for these treatments are possibly useful. For most of the other interventions there is insufficient evidence to make adequate conclusions on their efficacy. This includes the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline, all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) reviewed (paroxetine, citalopram, sertraline, and fluoxetine), the newer antidepressants atomoxetine and nefazodone, pergolide, Omega-3 fatty acids as well as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for the treatment of depression or depressive symptoms; methylphenidate and modafinil for the treatment of fatigue; amantadine for the treatment of pathological gambling; donepezil, galantamine, and memantine for the treatment of dementia; quetiapine for the treatment of psychosis; fludrocortisone and domperidone for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension; sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, ipratropium bromide spray for the treatment of sialorrhea; levodopa/carbidopa controlled release (CR), pergolide, eszopiclone, melatonin 3 to 5 mg and melatonin 50 mg for the treatment of insomnia and modafinil for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness.
   Due to safety issues the practice implication is that pergolide and nefazodone are not usful for the above-mentioned indications. Due to safety issues, olanzapine remains not useful for the treatment of psychosis. As none of the studies exceeded a duration of 6 months, the recommendations given are for the short-term management of the different non-motor symptoms. There were no RCTs that met inclusion criteria for the treatment of anxiety disorders, apathy, medication-related impulse control disorders and related behaviors other than pathological gambling, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), sweating, or urinary dysfunction. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence for the treatment of these indications. This EBM review of interventions for the non-motor symptoms of PD updates the field, but, because several RCTs are ongoing, a continual updating process is needed. Several interventions and indications still lack good quality evidence, and these gaps offer an opportunity for ongoing research. (C) 2011 Movement Disorder Society

TI  - Neuroimaging-Based Scalp Acupuncture Locations for Dementia
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Scalp acupuncture is a modality of acupuncture in which acupuncture needles are inserted into a certain layer of the scalp in order to affect the function of corresponding areas of the cerebral cortex and relieve symptoms. Clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of scalp acupuncture as a non-pharmacological treatment for dementia. Unfortunately, recent findings from brain neuroimaging studies on dementia have not been incorporated into scalp acupuncture. This study aims to integrate meta-analysis, resting-state functional connectivity, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to identify potential locations of scalp acupuncture for treatment of dementia. We found that the prefrontal cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, the middle and superior temporal gyrus, the temporal pole, the supplementary motor area, the inferior occipital gyrus, and the precuneus are involved in the pathophysiology of dementia and, therefore, may be the target areas of scalp acupuncture for dementia treatment. The neuroimaging-based scalp acupuncture protocol developed in this study may help to refine the locations for the treatment of dementia. Integrating multidisciplinary methods to identify key surface cortical areas associated with a certain disorder may shed light on the development of scalp acupuncture and other neuromodulation methods such as transcranial electrical current stimulation, particularly in the domain of identifying stimulation locations.

TI  - Mirror neurons and their relationship with neurodegenerative disorders
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH
AB  - The finding of mirror neurons (MNs) has provided a biological substrate to a new concept of cognition, relating data on actions and perceptions not only to integrate perception in action planning and execution but also as a neural mechanism supporting a wide range of cognitive functions. Here we first summarize data on MN localization and role in primates, then we report findings in normal human subjects: functional magnetic resonance imaging and neurophysiological studies sustain that MNs have a role in motor learning and recognizing actions and intentions of others, and they also support an embodied view of language, empathy, and memory. Then, we detail the results of literature searching on MNs and embodied cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD)/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/Alzheimer's disease (AD). In PD the network of MN could be altered, but its hyperactivation might support motor and cognitive performances at least in early stages. In the ALS/FTD continuum, preliminary evidence points out to an involvement of the MN network, which could explain language and inter-subjectivity deficits shown in patients affected by these clinical entities. In the MCI/AD spectrum, a few recent studies suggest a possible progressive involvement from posterior to anterior areas of the MN network, with the brain putting in place compensatory mechanisms in early stages. Reinterpreting neurodegenerative diseases at the light of the new views about brain organization stemming from the discovery of MN could help to better comprehend clinical manifestations and open new pathways to rehabilitation.

TI  - Degeneration of the cholinergic system in individuals with subjective cognitive decline: A systematic review
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a risk factor for future cognitive impairment and dementia. It is uncertain whether the neurodegeneration of the cholinergic system is already present in SCD individuals. We aimed to review the current evidence about the association between SCD and biomarkers of degeneration in the cholinergic system. Method: Original articles were extracted from three databases: Pubmed, Web of Sciences, and Scopus, in January 2023. Two researchers screened the studies independently. Results: A total of 11 research articles were selected. SCD was mostly based on amnestic cognitive complaints. Cholinergic system biomarkers included neuroimaging markers of basal forebrain volume, functional connectivity, transcranial magnetic stimulation, or biofluid. The evidence showed associations between basal forebrain atrophy, poorer connectivity of the cholinergic system, and SCD Conclusions: Degenerative changes in the cholinergic system can be present in SCD. Subjective complaints may help when identifying individuals with brain changes that are associated with cognitive impairment. These findings may have important implications in targeting individuals that may benefit from cholinergic-target treatments at very early stages of neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Therapeutic non-invasive brain treatments in Alzheimer's disease: recent advances and challenges
T2  - INFLAMMATION AND REGENERATION
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major neurodegenerative diseases and the most common form of dementia. Characterized by the loss of learning, memory, problem-solving, language, and other thinking abilities, AD exerts a detrimental effect on both patients' and families' quality of life. Although there have been significant advances in understanding the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis and progression of AD, there is no cure for AD. The failure of numerous molecular targeted pharmacologic clinical trials leads to an emerging research shift toward non-invasive therapies, especially multiple targeted non-invasive treatments. In this paper, we reviewed the advances of the most widely studied non-invasive therapies, including photobiomodulation (PBM), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and exercise therapy. Firstly, we reviewed the pathological changes of AD and the challenges for AD studies. We then introduced these non-invasive therapies and discussed the factors that may affect the effects of these therapies. Additionally, we review the effects of these therapies and the possible mechanisms underlying these effects. Finally, we summarized the challenges of the non-invasive treatments in future AD studies and clinical applications. We concluded that it would be critical to understand the exact underlying mechanisms and find the optimal treatment parameters to improve the translational value of these non-invasive therapies. Moreover, the combined use of non-invasive treatments is also a promising research direction for future studies and sheds light on the future treatment or prevention of AD.

TI  - Ataxic hemiparesis: a narrative review for clinical practice in rehabilitation
T2  - TOPICS IN STROKE REHABILITATION
AB  - BackgroundAtaxic hemiparesis (AH) is a well-recognized clinical lacunar stroke syndrome, characterized by paresis with ataxia on the same side of the body. It affects patients with stroke involving the basal ganglia, pons, internal capsule, corona radiata, and thalamus. In the past, lacunar syndrome denotes good functional recovery with low mortality and morbidity rate. However, recent evidence suggests AH has an association with more debilitating outcomes in the long term.ObjectiveTo provide a comprehensive narrative review of published literatures on the topics related with AH and update clinical practice including rehabilitation.MethodsLiterature review was performed by using the keywords "Subcortical Ataxia," "Lacunar Stroke," "Diaschisis", and "Ataxic Hemiparesis" on PubMed and Google Scholar Engines from 1978 to 2022. All papers published in English were reviewed and manual search of references from retrieved literature was performed for other relevant articles.ResultsA comprehensive review was carried out on the following topics: neuroanatomical localization, pathogenesis, clinical features and clinical assessment scales, pharmacological and non-pharmacological modalities for ataxia treatment, prognosis, and outcome.ConclusionAH imposes significant challenges on stroke survivors when it comes to remediation of balance and coordination. It is associated with increased risk of mortality, stroke recurrence, and dementia. Though application of the concept of neuroplasticity and the utilization of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation have shown early promising results, further research is needed to establish the practice guidelines for rehabilitation of patients with AH.

TI  - The beneficial effect on cognition of noninvasive brain stimulation intervention in patients with dementia: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
T2  - ALZHEIMERS RESEARCH & THERAPY
AB  - BackgroundDementia [i.e., Alzheimer disease (AD)], the most common neurodegenerative disease, causes profound negative impacts on executive function and quality of life. Available pharmacological treatments often fail to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, which focally modify cortical function and enhance synaptic long-term potentiation, are potentially beneficial for the cognition in patients with AD. The aim of the current network meta-analysis (NMA) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different NIBS interventions in patients with AD through NMA.MethodsOnly randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining NIBS interventions in patients with AD had been included. All NMA procedures were performed under the frequentist model. The primary and secondary outcomes were changes in cognitive function and quality of life, respectively.ResultsNineteen RCTs (639 participants) were included. The mean treatment and follow-up durations were 5.7 and 10.5 weeks, respectively. The combination of cathodal tDCS of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anodal tDCS over the right supraorbital region (c-tDCS-F3 + a-tDCS-Fp2) was associated with a significant beneficial effect on cognition compared with sham controls (standardized mean difference=2.43, 95% confidence interval=0.61-4.26, n=12 and 11). It was also associated with the greatest beneficial effect on cognition among all the investigated NIBS approaches. All the methods were well tolerated with regard to the safety profile, as reflected in the rates of adverse events or local discomfort, as well as acceptability, as indicated by dropout rate.ConclusionsThe present findings provide evidence of the benefits of NIBS, especially tDCS, for beneficial effect on cognition in patients with AD. However, because of few studies included, this effect was not replicated yet in the other studies. Therefore, future larger-scale and longer follow-up duration RCTs should be warranted.

TI  - Electrophysiological Studies in Healthy Subjects Involving Caffeine
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - We review the electrophysiological studies concerning the effects of caffeine on muscle, lower and upper motor neuron excitability and cognition. Several different methods have been used, such as electromyography, recruitment analysis, H-reflex, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroencephalography and event-related potentials. The positive effect of caffeine on vigilance, attention, speed of reaction, information processing and arousal is supported by a number of electrophysiological studies. The evidence in favor of an increased muscle fiber resistance is not definitive, but higher or lower motor neuron excitability can occur as a consequence of a greater excitation of the descending input from the brainstem and upper motor neurons. TMS can address the influence of caffeine on the upper motor neuron. Previous studies showed that cortico-motor threshold and intracortical excitatory and inhibitory pathways are not influenced by caffeine. Nonetheless, our results indicate that cortical silent period (CSP) is reduced in resting muscles after caffeine consumption, when stimulating the motor cortex with intensities slightly above threshold. We present new data demonstrating that this effect is also observed in fatigued muscle. We conclude that CSP can be considered a surrogate marker of the effect of caffeine in the brain, in particular of its central ergogenic effect.

TI  - Neuroimaging Findings Related to Behavioral Disturbances in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review
T2  - CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) associated with Alzheimer ' s Disease (AD) have been linked to structural and functional alterations in fronto-temporal circuits and cortical abnormalities. However, little is known on how specific volumetric and functional brain changes may be associated with the frequency, severity and pattern of BPSD.
   Methods: A systematic review of the literature regarding neuroimaging and BPSD changes in AD was performed through Pubmed/Medline, ISI, and EMBASE electronic databases from January 2000 to May 2015. Eligible references (n=40) included clinical studies in which structural or functional neuroimaging assessment was performed in AD subjects presenting BPSD features.
   Results: BPSD symptoms, particularly apathy and psychosis have been associated in most of studies with either volume reductions or decreased metabolism in the prefrontal cortex (orbital and dorsolateral portions), anterior cingulate, insula and temporal lobes (middle portion). WM lacunes associated with AD progression have been associated with depressive symptoms.
   Conclusion: The sum of evidence highlights the importance of BPSD-related imaging findings for the understanding of the non-cognitive symptom spectrum in AD. Results suggest that structural and functional changes in fronto-limbic areas may lead to emotional deregulation and symptom unawareness. As these findings may be present early on the AD clinical course, they may have a relevance for the development of imaging markers that could be used in diagnosis, disease monitoring and prediction of therapeutic response.

TI  - Cortical afferent inhibition abnormalities reveal cholinergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease: a reappraisal
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder affecting, besides the dopaminergic function, multiple neurotransmission systems, including the cholinergic system. Central cholinergic circuits of human brain can be tested non-invasively by coupling peripheral nerve stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex; this test is named short latency afferent inhibition (SAI). SAI abnormalities have been reported in PD patients with gait disturbances and many non-motor symptoms, such as visual hallucinations (VHs), REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), dysphagia, and olfactory impairment. The findings of these TMS studies strongly suggest that cholinergic degeneration is an important contributor to a number of clinical features of PD. TMS and neuropsychological raise the possibility that the presence of RBD, VHs and olfactory dysfunction indicate increased risk of cognitive impairment in patients with PD. Longitudinal studies of the patients are required to verify whether SAI abnormalities can predict a future severe cognitive decline. TMS can provide simple measures that may represent suitable biomarkers of cholinergic neurotransmission in PD. SAI studies enable an early recognition of PD patients with cholinergic system degeneration, and this might allow future targeted cholinergic treatment approaches, in addition to dopaminergic therapy, to ameliorate non-motor and motor clinical symptoms in PD patients.

TI  - Acetyl-L-Carnitine in Dementia and Other Cognitive Disorders: A Critical Update
T2  - NUTRIENTS
AB  - Several studies explored the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) in dementia, suggesting a role in slowing down cognitive decline. Nevertheless, in 2003 a systematic review concluded there was insufficient evidence to recommend a clinical use, although a meta-analysis in the same year showed a significant advantage for ALC for clinical scales and psychometric tests. Since then, other studies have been published; however, a critical review is still lacking. We provide an update of the studies on ALC in primary and secondary dementia, highlighting the current limitations and translational implications. Overall, the role of ALC in dementia is still under debate. The underlying mechanisms may include restoring of cell membranes and synaptic functioning, enhancing cholinergic activity, promoting mitochondrial energy metabolism, protecting against toxins, and exerting neurotrophic effects. The effects of ALC on the gut-liver-brain axis seem to identify the category of patients in which the new insights contribute most to the mechanisms of action of ALC, likely being the liver metabolism and the improvement of hepatic detoxifying mechanisms the primary targets. In this framework, our research group has dealt with this topic, focusing on the ALC-related cross-talk mechanisms. Further studies with homogeneous sample and longitudinal assessment are needed before a systematic clinical application.

TI  - Brain Magnetic Stimulation in Animal Models: A Valuable Lesson for Clinical Applications
T2  - CNS & NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS-DRUG TARGETS
AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is more than a mere tool for clinical non-invasive approaches to stimulate and synchronize the neuronal activity in the brain. Electromagnetic stimulation through TMS has recently emerged as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of different neurological disorders. Among the many properties recently discovered for TMS, its action as an accounting factor for neuroplasticity and neurogenesis is among its most promising features. Translational studies in animal models offer various advantages and also bridge this knowledge gap due to their direct assessment of the brain stimulation impact at the neural level. These profiles have been obtained through the study of animal models, which, in turn, have served for the establishment of the action mechanisms of this method. In this review, we revise and discuss evidence collected on the promising properties of TMS after visiting the different animal models developed so far, and provide a practical perspective of its possible application for clinical purposes.

TI  - Comparing Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) with Other Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: A Literature Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - PurposeIdentifying the effective treatments for diseases has been a critical issue in daily clinical practice, especially for Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Abundant evidence showed that non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has the potential to slow or reverse cognitive function decline. Among them, the transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) would be relatively safe for patients with AD. The purpose of this study was to review the relevant articles to explore the mechanism and effect of tDCS and other NIBS in AD treatment.MethodsAll the reported works were retrieved from two databases (i.e., PubMed and Google Scholar) by using the keywords "NIBS" and "AD". The mechanisms and effects of different NIBS applied in AD, including transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS), transcranial near-infrared (tNIR) light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and transcranial electric stimulation (TES) were reviewed.ResultsThe positive effects of TUS and tNIR on AD were supported by a few small samples and uncontrolled pilot studies. tDCS and repetitive TMS have been often used in an attempt to improve the cognition in people with brain disorders. Both the tDCS and TMS have benefits in AD by introducing long-term potentiation like change in synaptic strength. The reports showed that tDCS could be more safe, convenient, affordable, and well-tolerated method among all applications for AD treatment.ConclusionIn this review, it was shown that all the NIBS have positive effects on AD treatment. But, however, tDCS showed the great potential in improving the cognition of AD.

TI  - Depression in Parkinson disease-epidemiology, mechanisms and management
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS NEUROLOGY
AB  - Depression occurs in around 35% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and is often persistent. Symptoms of depression can be evident in individuals at the time of diagnosis and might develop in the premotor stage of the disease. The underlying mechanisms of depression in PD are not known in detail, but changes in brain structure, signaling by neurotransmitters, and levels of inflammatory and neurotrophic factors are all suggested to contribute to its development. Psychosocial factors and pain could also have roles in depression. Changes in dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems in patients with PD might help to explain the incidence of depression in these individuals. Antidepressants that have dual serotonergic and noradrenergic effects are the drugs of choice for treating depression in PD. However, antiparkinsonian drugs might have beneficial effects not only on the motor symptoms of disease, but also on a patient's mood. Deep brain stimulation can worsen depression in some patients, but a preliminary study has suggested that transcranial magnetic stimulation could improve symptoms of depression. This Review describes the frequency and course of depression in patients with PD. The mechanisms that underlie depression in this disease are also discussed, and the management strategies for these patients are highlighted.

TI  - The role of the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex in idiom comprehension: An rTMS study
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA
AB  - Previous research is equivocal with respect to the neural substrates of idiom processing. Particularly elusive is the role of the left ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), a region implicated in semantic control generally. Although fMRI studies have shown that the left VLPFC is active during idiom processing (see Rapp et al. (2012), for review), rTMS studies have failed to corroborate a clear role of this prefrontal region (e.g., Oliveri et al., 2004).
   We investigated this issue using a semantic meaningfulness judgment task that compared idiom comprehension following rTMS-stimulation to the left VLPFC relative to a control site (vertex). We also investigated whether individual differences in general cognitive capacity among comprehenders modulated the effects of rTMS.
   The results indicate that left VLPFC stimulation particularly affected the processing of low-familiar idioms, possibly because these items involve a maximal semantic conflict between a salient literal and less-known figurative meaning. Of note, this pattern only emerged for comprehenders with higher cognitive control capacity, possibly because they were more likely to activate or maintain multiple semantic representations during idiom processing, which required VLPFC integrity. Taken together, the results support the importance of the left VLPFC to idiom processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Working Memory and Transcranial-Alternating Current Stimulation-State of the Art: Findings, Missing, and Challenges
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Working memory (WM) is a cognitive process that involves maintaining and manipulating information for a short period of time. WM is central to many cognitive processes and declines rapidly with age. Deficits in WM are seen in older adults and in patients with dementia, schizophrenia, major depression, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, etc. The frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices are significantly involved in WM processing and all brain oscillations are implicated in tackling WM tasks, particularly theta and gamma bands. The theta/gamma neural code hypothesis assumes that retained memory items are recorded via theta-nested gamma cycles. Neuronal oscillations can be manipulated by sensory, invasive- and non-invasive brain stimulations. Transcranial alternating-current stimulation (tACS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are frequency-tuned non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques that have been used to entrain endogenous oscillations in a frequency-specific manner. Compared to rTMS, tACS demonstrates superior cost, tolerability, portability, and safety profile, making it an attractive potential tool for improving cognitive performance. Although cognitive research with tACS is still in its infancy compared to rTMS, a number of studies have shown a promising WM enhancement effect, especially in the elderly and patients with cognitive deficits. This review focuses on the various methods and outcomes of tACS on WM in healthy and unhealthy human adults and highlights the established findings, unknowns, challenges, and perspectives important for translating laboratory tACS into realistic clinical settings. This will allow researchers to identify gaps in the literature and develop frequency-tuned tACS protocols with promising safety and efficacy outcomes. Therefore, research efforts in this direction should help to consider frequency-tuned tACS as a non-pharmacological tool of cognitive rehabilitation in physiological aging and patients with cognitive deficits.

TI  - Cognitive impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, clues from the SOD1 mouse
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is now recognized as a multisystem disorder, in which the primary pathology is the degeneration of motor neurons, with cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunctions that constitutes the non-motor manifestations of ALS. The combination of clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data, and detailed genetic studies suggest that ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) might form part of a disease continuum, with pure ALS and pure FTD at the two extremes.
   Mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene were the first genetic mutations linked to the insurgence of ALS. Since that discovery numerous animal models carrying SOD1 mutations have been created. Despite their limitations these animal models, particularly the mice, have broaden our knowledge on the system alterations occurring in the ALS spectrum of disorders.
   The present review aims at providing an overview of the data obtained with the SOD1 animal models first and foremost on the cortical and subcortical regions, the cortico-striatal and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, dendritic branching and glutamate receptors function.

TI  - Interest of transcranial stimulation in pelvic and perineal disorders
T2  - PROGRES EN UROLOGIE
AB  - Objective. - The aim of this article was to describe the diagnostic and therapeutic value of transcranial stimulation in pelvic and perineal disorders.
   Methods. - A literature review (Medline database and Google scholar) with no time limit was performed using keywords: "transcranial direct stimulation", "transcranial magnetic stimulation", "neurogenic bladder", "urinary incontinence", "Parkinson disease", "multiple sclerosis", "stroke", "muscle spasticity", "pelvic pain", "visceral pain".
   Results. - Twelve articles have been selected. Transcranial magnetic or electrical stimulation is a noninvasive neuromodulation technique widely used to establish brain maps to highlight causal relationships between brain and function. Regarding pelvic-perineal disorders, repeated transcranial stimulation has shown significant effects for the treatment of overactive bladder in Parkinson's disease (P < 0.05) and multiple sclerosis, but also for the treatment of refractory chronic pelvic pain (P = 0.026). Finally, therapeutic effects have also been demonstrated in irritable bowel syndrome. No evidence of efficacy was found on genito-sexual disorders.
   Conclusion. - Data from the literature suggest that transcranial stimulation is a noninvasive treatment that may have a role in the management of pelvic and perinea( disorders. Its promising field of action would require prospective and randomized studies on a larger scale. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Clinical neurophysiology of aging brain: From normal aging to neurodegeneration
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Physiological brain aging is characterized by a loss of synaptic contacts and neuronal apoptosis that provokes age-dependant decline of sensory processing, motor performance, and cognitive function. Neural redundancy and plastic remodelling of brain networking, also secondary to mental and physical training, promotes maintenance of brain activity in healthy elderly for everyday life and fully productive affective and intellectual capabilities. However, age is the main risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that impact on cognition. Oscillatory electromagnetic brain activity is a hallmark of neuronal network function in various brain regions. Modem neurophysiological techniques including electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potential (ERP), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can accurately index normal and abnormal brain aging to facilitate non-invasive analysis of cortico-cortical connectivity and neuronal synchronization of firing and coherence of rhythmic oscillations at various frequencies. The present review provides a perspective of these issues by assaying different neurophysiological methods and integrating the results with functional brain imaging findings. It is concluded that discrimination between physiological and pathological brain aging clearly emerges at the group level, with applications at the individual level also suggested. Integrated approaches utilizing neurophysiological techniques together with biological markers and structural and functional imaging are promising for large-scale, low-cost and non-invasive evaluation of at-risk populations. Practical implications of the methods are emphasized. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Neural circuits of idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus: A perspective review of brain connectivity and symptoms meta-analysis
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a prevalent reversible neurological disorder characterized by impaired locomotion, cognition and urinary control with ventriculomegaly. Symptoms can be relieved with cerebrospinal fluid drainage, which makes iNPH the leading cause of reversible dementia. Because of a limited understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, unspecific symptoms and the high prevalence of comorbidity (i.e. Alzheimer's disease), iNPH is largely underdiagnosed. For these reasons, there is an urgent need for developing noninvasive quantitative biomarkers for iNPH diagnosis and prognosis. Structural and functional changes of brain circuits in relation to symptoms and treatment response are expected to deliver major advances in this direction. We review structural and functional brain connectivity findings in iNPH and complement those findings with iNPH symptom meta-analyses in healthy populations. Our goal is to reinforce our conceptualization of iNPH as to brain network mechanisms and foster the development of new hypotheses for future research and treatment options.

TI  - Acute aerobic exercise and neuroplasticity of the motor cortex: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE IN SPORT
AB  - Objectives: To synthesise the existing literature investigating if acute aerobic exercise enhances the response to experimentally-induced neuroplasticity paradigms.
   Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases Medline, Psyclnfo and Embase was undertaken on 26 April 2018 and updated on 17 May 2019. Studies were included if they involved a bout of aerobic exercise; prescribed a bout of rest as a control condition; utilized a non-invasive brain stimulation paradigm to induce neuroplasticity; used TMS to assess neuroplasticity outcomes: participants were healthy 18-65 year old males and females with no diagnosed neurological/psychological impairments.
   Results: Eight papers (containing 12 experiments) met inclusion criteria. All studies utilized cycling or treadmill exercise as their exercise modality, and exercise intensity ranged from low intensity continuous exercise to high-intensity interval exercise. Four neuroplasticity paradigms were employed including paired associative stimulation (PAS) (n =3), continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) (n=2), intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) (n=2) and transcranial direct current stimulation (n =1). Aerobic exercise enhanced neuroplastic responses (compared to rest) in seven of the 12 experiments.
   Conclusions: This review provides emerging evidence that acute aerobic exercise can enhance the response to experimentally-induced neuroplasticity paradigms. However, there remains great variability in the study design and reporting of effects in these studies and thus a more standardized approach is encouraged to better understand the relationship between acute aerobic exercise and neuroplasticity. Future studies should consider optimizing intensity, paradigms and duration of both exercise and neuroplasticity paradigms employed. (C) 2019 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Brain Stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Brain stimulation techniques can modulate cognitive functions in many neuropsychiatric diseases. Pilot studies have shown promising effects of brain stimulations on Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain stimulations can be categorized into non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) and invasive brain stimulation (IBS). IBS includes deep brain stimulation (DBS), and invasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), whereas NIBS includes transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), electroconvulsive treatment (ECT), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), cranial electrostimulation (CES), and non-invasive VNS. We reviewed the cutting-edge research on these brain stimulation techniques and discussed their therapeutic effects on AD. Both IBS and NIBS may have potential to be developed as novel treatments for AD; however, mixed findings may result from different study designs, patients selection, population, or samples sizes. Therefore, the efficacy of NIBS and IBS in AD remains uncertain, and needs to be further investigated. Moreover, more standardized study designs with larger sample sizes and longitudinal follow-up are warranted for establishing a structural guide for future studies and clinical application.

TI  - Neurosurgical Approaches to Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
AB  - Levodopa has long been the standard of care for Parkinson disease (PD); however, the eventual onset of motor fluctuations and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) complicates its utility in advanced PD. Current neurosurgical interventions remain some of the best options for LID. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently the procedure of choice for patients with advanced PD, patients refractory to medical management, and patients with motor complications from levodopa therapy.
   Significant progress has been achieved in recent years, however, as newer techniques are making their way through preclinical and clinical studies. Use of interventional magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) and a skull-mounted aiming device to guide electrode placement has improved accuracy in recent DBS studies. Adaptive "closed-loop" DBS represents another exciting advancement in the field, in which real-time feedback allows dynamic modulation of the stimulation delivered to the basal ganglia. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a novel approach to creating precise lesioning in the brain that has shown promising results in preliminary studies for various movement disorders, including dyskinesias, and may transform the neuroablation field. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, which can induce local and distant effects in cortical and subcortical areas, has shown efficacy in managing certain PD and LID symptoms in early studies. Finally, direct stimulation of the motor cortex and the cerebellum has shown therapeutic effects in PD and LID patients in certain studies. Taken together, many of these new techniques have shown great promise in early studies and may eventually be preferred treatment options for LID patients.

TI  - Physiological changes in neurodegeneration - mechanistic insights and clinical utility
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS NEUROLOGY
AB  - The effects of neurodegenerative syndromes extend beyond cognitive function to involve key physiological processes, including eating and metabolism, autonomic nervous system function, sleep, and motor function. Changes in these physiological processes are present in several conditions, including frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease and the parkinsonian plus conditions. Key neural structures that mediate physiological changes across these conditions include neuroendocrine and hypothalamic pathways, reward pathways, motor systems and the autonomic nervous system. In this Review, we highlight the key changes in physiological processing in neurodegenerative syndromes and the similarities in these changes between different progressive neurodegenerative brain conditions. The changes and similarities between disorders might provide novel insights into the human neural correlates of physiological functioning. Given the evidence that physiological changes can arise early in the neurodegenerative process, these changes could provide biomarkers to aid in the early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and in treatment trials.

TI  - Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of depression in older adults: A report from the Japanese Society of mood disorders
T2  - PSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES
AB  - The Committee for Treatment Guidelines of Mood Disorders, Japanese Society of Mood Disorders, published a Japanese guideline for the treatment of late-life depression in 2020. Based on that guideline, the present guideline was developed and revised to incorporate the suggestions of global experts and the latest published evidence. In the diagnosis of late-life depression, it is important to carefully differentiate it from bipolar disorders, depressive states caused by physical and organic brain disease, drug effects, and dementia, and to determine the comorbidity between late-life depression and dementia. It is necessary to fully understand the clinical characteristics and psychosocial background of late-life depression, evaluate the patient's condition, and provide basic interventions based on these factors. Problem-solving therapy, reminiscence therapy/life review therapy, and behavioral activation therapy, and other forms of psychotherapy can reduce depressive symptoms. In terms of pharmacotherapy, newer antidepressants or non-tricyclic antidepressants are recommended for late-life depression, and it is recommended that the efficacy of least the minimal effective dosage should first be determined. Switching antidepressants and aripiprazole augmentation can be used to treatment-resistant therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation have demonstrated usefulness for late-life depression. Exercise therapy, high-intensity light therapy, and diet therapy also show some effectiveness and are useful for late-life depression. Continuation therapy should be maintained for at least 1 year after remission.

T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is one of the most prevalent forms of neurodegenerative dementia, second to Alzheimer's disease, and autonomic abnormalities and depressive symptoms are common. There are currently no cures or treatments with evidence of disease-modifying effects for DLB, and the treatment for the amelioration of targeted symptoms is challenging due to the risk of side effects and drug-drug interactions. In the present case, we report a female elder with DLB suffering from poor tolerance to the adverse events of numerous approaches. Following intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), the autonomic abnormalities and depressive symptoms remarkably improved without significant side effects.

TI  - The Dynamic Duo: Combining noninvasive brain stimulation with cognitive interventions
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS)(1) each show efficacy in the treat-ment of psychiatric disorders; however, more efficacious interventions are needed as reflected by an overall unmet need in mental health care. While each modality has typically been studied and developed as a mono-therapy, in practice they are typically used in combination. Research has begun to emerge studying the potential synergistic actions of multi-modal, combination therapies. For example, NIBS combined with rehabilitation strategies have demonstrated some success for speech and motor rehabilitation in stroke patients. In this review we present evidence suggesting that combining NIBS with targeted, cognitive interventions offers a potentially powerful new approach to treating neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we focus on NIBS studies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)(2)` and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)(3) given that these modalities are relatively safe, noninvasive, and can be performed simultaneously with neurocognitive interventions. We review the concept of "state dependent" effects of NIBS and highlight how simultaneous or sequential cognitive in-terventions could help optimize NIBS therapy by providing further control of ongoing neural activity in targeted neural networks. This review spans a range of neuropsychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, generalized anxiety, and autism. For each disorder, we emphasize neuroanatomical circuitry that could be engaged with combination therapy and critically discuss the literature that has begun to emerge. Finally, we present possible underlying mechanisms and propose future research strategies that may further refine the potential of combination therapies.

TI  - Meta-analytic Evidence for the Plurality of Mechanisms in Transdiagnostic Structural MRI Studies of Hallucination Status
T2  - ECLINICALMEDICINE
AB  - Background: Hallucinations are transmodal and transdiagnostic phenomena, occurring across sensorymodalities and presenting in psychiatric, neurodegenerative, neurological, and non-clinical populations. Despite their cross-category occurrence, little empirical work has directly compared between-group neural correlates of hallucinations.
   Methods: We performed whole-brain voxelwisemeta-analyses of hallucination status across diagnoses using anisotropic effect-size seed-based d mapping (AES-SDM), and conducted a comprehensive systematic review in PubMed and Web of Science until May 2018 on other structural correlates of hallucinations, including cortical thickness and gyrification.
   Findings: 3214 abstractswere identified. Patientswith psychiatric disorders and hallucinations (eight studies) exhibited reduced gray matter (GM) in the left insula, right inferior frontal gyrus, left anterior cingulate/paracingulate gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and increased in the bilateral fusiform gyrus, while patients with neurodegenerative disorders with hallucinations (eight studies) showed GM decreases in the left lingual gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus/parietal operculum, left parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiformgyrus, right thalamus, and right lateral occipital gyrus. Group differences between psychiatric and neurodegenerative hallucination meta-analyses were formally confirmed using Monte Carlo randomizations to determine statistical significance, and a jackknife sensitivity analysis established the reproducibility of results across nearly all study combinations. For other structuralmeasures (28 studies), the most consistent findings associated with hallucination statuswere reduced cortical thickness in temporal gyri in schizophrenia and altered hippocampal volume in Parkinson's disease and dementia. Additionally, increased severity of hallucinations in schizophrenia correlated with GM reductions within the left superior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, bilateral supramarginal and angular gyri.
   Interpretation: Distinct patterns of neuroanatomical alteration characterize hallucination status in patients with psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a plurality of anatomical signatures. This approach has implications for treatment, theoretical frameworks, and generates refutable predictions for hallucinations in other diseases and their occurrence within the general population.

TI  - Non-pharmacological intervention for memory decline
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Non-pharmacological intervention of memory difficulties in healthy older adults, as well as those with brain damage and neurodegenerative disorders, has gained much attention in recent years. The two main reasons that explain this growing interest in memory rehabilitation are the limited efficacy of current drug therapies and the plasticity of the human central nervous and the discovery that during aging, the connections in the brain are not fixed but retain the capacity to change with learning. Moreover, several studies have reported enhanced cognitive performance in patients with neurological disease, following non-invasive brain stimulation [i.e., repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation to specific cortical areas]. The present review provides an overview of memory rehabilitation in individuals with mild cognitive impairment and inpatients with Alzheimer's disease with particular regard to cognitive rehabilitation interventions focused on memory and non-invasive brain stimulation. Reviewed data suggest that in patients with memory deficits, memory intervention therapy could lead to performance improvements in memory, nevertheless further studies need to be conducted in order to establish the real value of this approach.

TI  - Brain stimulation in posttraumatic stress disorder
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY
AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex, heterogeneous disorder that develops following trauma and often includes perceptual, cognitive, affective, physiological, and psychological features. PTSD is characterized by hyperarousal, intrusive thoughts, exaggerated startle response, flashbacks, nightmares, sleep disturbances, emotional numbness, and persistent avoidance of trauma-associated stimuli. The efficacy of available treatments for PTSD may result in part from relief of associated depressive and anxiety-related symptoms in addition to treatment of core symptoms that derive from reexperiencing, numbing, and hyperarousal. Diverse, heterogeneous mechanisms of action and the ability to act broadly or very locally may enable brain stimulation devices to address PTSD core symptoms in more targeted ways. To achieve this goal, specific theoretical bases derived from novel, well-designed research protocols will be necessary. Brain stimulation devices include both long-used and new electrical and magnetic devices. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) have both been in use for decades; transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), deep brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) have been developed recently, over approximately the past twenty years. The efficacy of brain stimulation has been demonstrated as a treatment for psychiatric and neurological disorders such as anxiety (CES), depression (ECT, CES, rTMS, VNS, DBS), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (DBS), essential tremor, dystonia (DBS), epilepsy (DBS, VNS), Parkinson Disease (DBS), pain (CES), and insomnia (CES). To date, limited data on brain stimulation for PTSD offer only modest guidance. ECT has shown some efficacy in reducing comorbid depression in PTSD patients but has not been demonstrated to improve most core PTSD symptoms. CES and VNS have shown some efficacy in reducing anxiety, findings that may suggest possible utility in relieving PTSD-associated anxiety. Treatment of animal models of PTSD with DBS suggests potential human benefit. Additional research and novel treatment options for PTSD are urgently needed. The potential usefulness of brain stimulation in treating PTSD deserves further exploration.

TI  - Role of amyloid-β CSF levels in cognitive deficit in MS
T2  - CLINICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disease of the young adults. Although being long considered as a pure white matter (WM) disease, growing evidence indicates that in MS the gray matter (GM) is affected as well, and that GM pathology correlates with cognitive function deterioration in MS. Indeed, MS is increasingly recognized to cause cognitive deficits since its early stages. Therefore, the identification of a biomarker with good diagnostic and prognostic power is of great importance for monitoring and preventing cognitive impairment in MS patients. A possibility arises from the combination of two different measures of neuronal injury: the levels of amyloid-beta(1-42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which have been found associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease (AD); the brain synaptic plasticity, which is a measure of cognitive reserve and can be explored safely in humans by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation.
   In this review, we discuss the relevance of amyloid-beta(1-42) in MS disease and its link to long-term potentiation (LTP), which is the most studied form of synaptic plasticity, providing evidence for their combined use in cognitive assessment in MS patients.

TI  - What can gait tell us about dementia? Review of epidemiological and neuropsychological evidence
T2  - GAIT & POSTURE
AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment and gait disorders in people over the age of 65 represent major public health issues because of their high frequency, their link to poor outcomes and high costs. Research has demonstrated that these two geriatric syndromes are closely related.
   Methods and results: We aim to review the evidence supporting the relationship between gait and cognitive impairment, particularly focusing on epidemiological and neuropsychological studies in patients with Mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease and Vascular dementia. The review demonstrates that gait and cognition are closely related, but our knowledge of their interrelationship is limited. Emerging evidence shows that gait analysis has the potential to contribute to diagnosis and prognosis of cognitive impairment.
   Conclusions: An integrated approach for evaluating these major geriatric syndromes, based on their close relationship, will not only increase our understanding of cognitive-motor interactions, but most importantly may be used to aid early diagnosis, prognosis and the development of new interventions.

TI  - Alzheimer's disease with frailty: Prevalence, screening, assessment, intervention strategies and challenges
T2  - BIOSCIENCE TRENDS
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions worldwide and is expected to surge in prevalence due to aging populations. Frailty, characterized by muscle function decline, becomes more prevalent with age, imposing substantial burdens on patients and caregivers. This paper aimed to comprehensively review the current literature on AD coupled with frailty, encompassing prevalence, screening, assessment, and treatment while delving into the field's challenges and future trajectories. Frailty and AD coexist in more than 30% of cases, with hazard ratios above 120% indicating a mutually detrimental association.Various screening tools have emerged for both frailty and AD, including the Fried Frailty Phenotype (FP), FRAIL scale, Edmonton Frailty Scale (EFS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), and General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG). However, none has solidified its role as the definitive gold standard. The convergence of electronic health records and brain aging biomarkers heralds a new era in AD with frailty screening and assessment. In terms of intervention, non-pharmacological strategies spanning nutrition, horticulture, exercise, and social interaction, along with pharmacological approaches involving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors ( AChEIs), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, and anti-amyloid beta- protein medications, constituted cornerstones for treating AD coupled with frailty. Technological interventions like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) also entered the fold. Notably, multi-domain non-pharmacological interventions wield considerable potential in enhancing cognition and mitigating disability. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions necessitate further validation. Diagnosing and managing AD with frailty present several daunting challenges, encompassing low rates of early co-diagnosis, limited clinical trial evidence, and scarce integrated, pioneering service delivery models. These challenges demand heightened attention through robust research and pragmatic implementation.

T2  - NATURE REVIEWS NEUROLOGY
AB  - Dopamine replacement is a mainstay of therapeutic strategies for Parkinson disease (PD). The motor response to therapy involves an immediate improvement in motor function, known as the short-duration response (SDR), followed by a long-duration response (LDR) that develops more slowly, over weeks. Here, we review evidence in patients and animal models suggesting that dopamine-dependent corticostriatal plasticity, and retention of such plasticity in the absence of dopamine, are the mechanisms underlying the LDR. Conversely, experience-dependent aberrant plasticity that develops slowly under reduced dopamine levels could contribute substantially to PD motor symptoms before initiation of dopamine replacement therapy. We place these findings in the context of the role of dopamine in basal ganglia function and corticostriatal plasticity, and provide a new framework suggesting that therapies that enhance the LDR could be more effective than those targeting the SDR. We further propose that changes in neuroplasticity constitute a form of disease modification that is distinct from prevention of degeneration, and could be responsible for some of the unexplained disease-modifying effects of certain therapies. Understanding such plasticity could provide novel therapeutic approaches that combine rehabilitation and pharmacotherapy for treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders involving basal ganglia dysfunction.

TI  - The Brain Connectivity Basis of Semantic Dementia: A Selective Review
T2  - CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
AB  - Semantic dementia (SD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of semantic memory and conceptual knowledge, coupled with asymmetric local brain atrophy concentrated in the anterior temporal lobe. Recent developments in neuroimaging techniques, especially the emergence of the "human connectomics," have made possible the study of the brain's functional and structural connections and the topological properties of the brain networks. Recent studies applying these techniques have shown that SD manifests extensive structural and functional connectivity alterations, providing important insights into the pathogenesis of SD and the neural basis of semantic memory in general. In this review, we present and discuss the existing findings about the brain connectivity changes in SD and how they might be related to the various behavioral deficits associated with this disorder and propose important unanswered questions that warrant further investigation.

TI  - Advancing the Neurophysiological Understanding of Delirium
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
AB  - Delirium is a common problem associated with substantial morbidity and increased mortality. However, the brain dysfunction that leads some individuals to develop delirium in response to stressors is unclear. In this article, we briefly review the neurophysiologic literature characterizing the changes in brain function that occur in delirium, and in other cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Based on this literature, we propose a conceptual model for delirium. We propose that delirium results from a breakdown of brain function in individuals with impairments in brain connectivity and brain plasticity exposed to a stressor. The validity of this conceptual model can be tested using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in combination with Electroencephalography, and, if accurate, could lead to the development of biomarkers for delirium risk in individual patients. This model could also be used to guide interventions to decrease the risk of cerebral dysfunction in patients preoperatively, and facilitate recovery in patients during or after an episode of delirium.

TI  - The neural correlates of apathy in the context of aging and brain disorders: a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - IntroductionApathy is a prevalent mood disturbance that occurs in a wide range of populations, including those with normal cognitive aging, mental disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and traumatic brain injuries. Recently, neuroimaging technologies have been employed to elucidate the neural substrates underlying brain disorders accompanying apathy. However, the consistent neural correlates of apathy across normal aging and brain disorders are still unclear. MethodsThis paper first provides a brief review of the neural mechanism of apathy in healthy elderly individuals, those with mental disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, and traumatic brain injuries. Further, following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the structural and functional neuroimaging meta-analysis using activation likelihood estimation method is performed on the apathy group with brain disorders and the healthy elderly, aiming at exploring the neural correlates of apathy. ResultsThe structural neuroimaging meta-analysis showed that gray matter atrophy is associated with apathy in the bilateral precentral gyrus (BA 13/6), bilateral insula (BA 47), bilateral medial frontal gyrus (BA 11), bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, left caudate (putamen) and right anterior cingulate, while the functional neuroimaging meta-analysis suggested that the functional connectivity in putamen and lateral globus pallidus is correlated with apathy. DiscussionThrough the neuroimaging meta-analysis, this study has identified the potential neural locations of apathy in terms of brain structure and function, which may offer valuable pathophysiological insights for developing more effective therapeutic interventions for affected patients.

TI  - Treatment for depression comorbid with dementia
T2  - EVIDENCE-BASED MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Depression is a common comorbidity in dementia. Randomised controlled studies of antidepressants do not show a significant improvement in depressive symptoms in patients with comorbid dementia and are known to lead to an increase in side effects. However, there are relatively few studies of depression in dementia, and drawing firm conclusions about the use of antidepressants is limited by the amount of data available. Furthermore, it is unclear whether data can be extrapolated from similar populations (eg, those with late-life depression) to inform pharmacotherapy in this patient group. Given the lack of effectiveness and risk of side effects associated with pharmacological treatments, psychological interventions may offer important therapeutic benefits. There is evidence for the effectiveness of individual psychological therapy, and further research will establish which psychological approach is the most effective. Some studies have shown an improvement in depressive symptoms using structured sleep hygiene programmes, exercise, arts interventions and music therapy. These studies are hampered by small data sets, and the benefits to individuals may not be well captured by standard outcome measures. At present, the best evidence for arts-based approaches is in music therapy. Depression with comorbid dementia responds well to electroconvulsive therapy and this is a useful treatment modality for those with severe or life-threatening depressive symptoms. Alternative neurostimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation are not widely used at present and further research is needed before they can be a more widely used treatment modality.

TI  - The Mechanism of Chemical and Physical Intervention on Prevention and Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - PROGRESS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common central neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and memory loss. It has become one of the most serious problems in geriatric medicine with a large number of incidences and a wide range of effects. Clinical drug treatment of AD has limited effects, and there are certain limitations and side effects. At present, the treatment methods of chemical and physical intervention for AD are gradually attracting people's attention. Olfactory intervention stimulated by odor or electrode can enhance excitability and synaptic transmission of olfactory neurons. Therapy of photobiomodulation can raise cerebral blood flow, promote nerve excitation and neuronal plasticity. Photothermal therapy can be used to decompose of A beta aggregates.. oscillations induced by 40 Hz audiovisual stimulation is mainly targeted to decrease amyloid plaques. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) regulate neuronal activity and excitability in the brain by directly inducing action potentials and increasing the resting membrane potential of cortical neurons, respectively. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) modulates cognitive function through entrainment and resonance effects that bring large populations of neurons into local oscillating networks. Exposure to a thermoneutral environment can reduce insoluble A beta while repeated short-term cold exposure at 4. can block hypothermia-induced Tau hyperphosphorylation. Studies have shown that chemical and physical intervention such as olfactory intervention, light therapy, electrical brain stimulation, acoustic and optical stimulation, temperature intervention can improve metabolism by improving neurogenesis, neuroprotection, neuronal excitability, neuronal plasticity, cerebral blood flow, reducing A beta deposition and Tau hyperphosphorylation to improve AD symptoms and cognitive function. This article reviews the mechanism and efficacy of different physical interventions on AD, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the implementation of physical interventions to prevent and delay AD.

TI  - The missing link between sleep disorders and age-related dementia: recent evidence and plausible mechanisms
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION
AB  - Sleep disorders are among the most common clinical problems and possess a significant concern for the geriatric population. More importantly, while around 40% of elderly adults have sleep-related complaints, sleep disorders are more frequently associated with co-morbidities including age-related neurodegenerative diseases and mild cognitive impairment. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that disturbed sleep may not only serve as the consequence of brain atrophy, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia and, therefore, significantly increase dementia risk. Since the current therapeutic interventions lack efficacies to prevent, delay or reverse the pathological progress of dementia, a better understanding of underlying mechanisms by which sleep disorders interact with the pathogenesis of dementia will provide possible targets for the prevention and treatment of dementia. In this review, we briefly describe the physiological roles of sleep in learning/memory, and specifically update the recent research evidence demonstrating the association between sleep disorders and dementia. Plausible mechanisms are further discussed. Moreover, we also evaluate the possibility of sleep therapy as a potential intervention for dementia.

TI  - Machine Learning Algorithms and Statistical Approaches for Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Based on Resting-State EEG Recordings: A Systematic Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common type of dementia with a great prevalence in western countries. The diagnosis of AD and its progression is performed through a variety of clinical procedures including neuropsychological and physical examination, Electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, brain imaging and blood analysis. During the last decades, analysis of the electrophysiological dynamics in AD patients has gained great research interest, as an alternative and cost-effective approach. This paper summarizes recent publications focusing on (a) AD detection and (b) the correlation of quantitative EEG features with AD progression, as it is estimated by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. A total of 49 experimental studies published from 2009 until 2020, which apply machine learning algorithms on resting state EEG recordings from AD patients, are reviewed. Results of each experimental study are presented and compared. The majority of the studies focus on AD detection incorporating Support Vector Machines, while deep learning techniques have not yet been applied on large EEG datasets. Promising conclusions for future studies are presented.

TI  - The visual system as target of non-invasive brain stimulation for migraine treatment: Current insights and future challenges
T2  - UPDATE ON EMERGING TREATMENTS FOR MIGRAINE
AB  - The visual network is crucially implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. Several lines of evidence indicate that migraine is characterized by an altered visual cortex excitability both during and between attacks. Visual symptoms, the most common clinical manifestation of migraine aura, are likely the result of cortical spreading depression originating from the extrastriate area V3A. Photophobia, a clinical hallmark of migraine, is linked to an abnormal sensory processing of the thalamus which is converged with the non-image forming visual pathway. Finally, visual snow is an increasingly recognized persistent visual phenomenon in migraine, possibly caused by increased perception of subthreshold visual stimuli.
   Emerging research in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has vastly developed into a diversity of areas with promising potential. One of its clinical applications is the single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (sTMS) applied over the occipital cortex which has been approved for treating migraine with aura, albeit limited evidence. Studies have also investigated other NIBS techniques, such as repetitive TMS (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), for migraine prophylaxis but with conflicting results. As a dynamic brain disorder with widespread pathophysiology, targeting migraine with NIBS is challenging. Furthermore, unlike the motor cortex, evidence suggests that the visual cortex may be less plastic. Controversy exists as to whether the same fundamental principles of NIBS, based mainly on findings in the motor cortex, can be applied to the visual cortex.
   This review aims to explore existing literature surrounding NIBS studies on the visual system of migraine. We will first provide an overview highlighting the direct implication of the visual network in migraine. Next, we will focus on the rationale behind using NIBS for migraine treatment, including its effects on the visual cortex, and the shortcomings of currently available evidence. Finally, we propose a broader perspective of how novel approaches, the concept of brain networks and the integration of multimodal imaging with computational modeling, can help refine current NIBS methods, with the ultimate goal of optimizing a more individualized treatment for migraine.

TI  - Impairment- and activity/participation-directed interventions in progressive language impairment: Clinical and theoretical issues
T2  - APHASIOLOGY
AB  - Background: There is a broad constellation of clinical syndromes in which the most prominent initial and ongoing symptom is deterioration in spoken or receptive language processing, reading, writing, or semantic knowledge. Despite the core language impairments, people with these disorders are likely to be under-referred for speech pathology services (Taylor, Kingma, Croot, Nickels, 2009 this issue), and there is limited published research on speech pathology interventions in these disorders. Aims: This paper reviews the published impairment- and activity/participation-directed interventions in semantic dementia and progressive aphasia to determine the current evidence base for clinical decisions about client suitability and selection of treatment goals, methods, and measures. We also identify questions that need to be addressed in future therapy research. Methods Procedures: We reviewed 15 reports of impairment-directed behavioural, pharmacological, and repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments that implemented some level of experimental control. We reviewed a further 10 reports of interventions generally carried out without experimental control, targeting impairments, activity/participation limitations, education, carer training, or a mixture of these approaches. Outcomes Results: In the impairment-directed studies almost all participants showed improvement on treated items immediately post-treatment. Improvement was specific to treated items in most word retrieval studies, but there is a possibility that greater generalisation to other items or other language tasks/contexts may have occurred in treatments not targeting naming, and/or for clients with articulatory impairments. Without ongoing practice of therapy activities, treatment gains declined for all participants over a period varying from 2 months to between 6 months and 1 year. There was only one experimentally controlled activity/participation-directed intervention reported for people with progressive language impairments, although other reports of activity/participation-directed interventions described increased communicativeness and communication effectiveness for participants following intervention. Consistent with the aims of activity/participation-interventions, these interventions appear to have a greater impact on everyday communication outside the clinic than impairment-directed interventions, but these impacts need to be investigated and documented. Conclusions: These studies highlight the need for rigorous research design to identify treatment, generalisation, and maintenance effects (Rapp Glucroft, 2009 this issue), and to identify outcomes that go beyond improvement in the clinic on targeted words, language structures, and behaviours. It is important to tailor interventions closely to individual client needs, involve the spouse/carer in intervention, and ensure that clients have appropriate expectations about therapy. The patterns of therapy gain, limited generalisation, and decline following cessation of therapy activities in impairment-directed studies raise questions about the learning mechanism(s) involved. They also have implications for client suitability, and for choice of therapy items, and therapy delivery and duration.

TI  - Nouns and verbs in the brain: A review of behavioural, electrophysiological, neuropsychological and imaging studies
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - In the past 30 years there has been a growing body of research using different methods (behavioural, electrophysiological, neuropsychological, TMS and imaging studies) asking whether processing words from different grammatical classes (especially nouns and verbs) engage different neural systems. To date, however, each line of investigation has provided conflicting results. Here we present a review of this literature, showing that once we take into account the confounding in most studies between semantic distinctions (objects vs. actions) and grammatical distinction (nouns vs. verbs), and the conflation between studies concerned with mechanisms of single word processing and those studies concerned with sentence integration, the emerging picture is relatively clear-cut: clear neural separability is observed between the processing of object words (nouns) and action words (typically verbs), grammatical class effects emerge or become stronger for tasks and languages imposing greater processing demands. These findings indicate that grammatical class per se is not an organisational principle of knowledge in the brain; rather, all the findings we review are compatible with two general principles described by typological linguistics as underlying grammatical class membership across languages: semantic/pragmatic, and distributional cues in language that distinguish nouns from verbs. These two general principles are incorporated within an emergentist view which takes these constraints into account. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment and Management of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease
T2  - CNS DRUGS
AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms are highly prevalent in Parkinson's disease and associated with decreased quality of life and adverse health outcomes. In this review, the assessment and management of common neuropsychiatric symptoms are discussed: depression, anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment, dementia and apathy. Validated assessment scales are now available for the majority of symptoms. Balancing dopaminergic therapy plays an important role in their management as increasing doses of dopaminergic agents might address depression and anxiety related to 'off' phases, non-motor fluctuations and apathy, while dose reduction might alleviate psychotic symptoms. More targeted treatment is possible through medications utilising different pathways. Although efficacy profiles of individual agents require further exploration, antidepressants as a drug class have shown utility in depression and anxiety in Parkinson's disease. Psychological therapies, especially cognitive behavioural approaches, are effective. Pimavanserin allows the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease without directly affecting the dopaminergic and cholinergic system. The cholinergic system is currently the only target in Parkinson's disease dementia, and antagonists of this system, as are many psychotropic drugs, need to be used with caution. Management of apathy largely relies on non-pharmacological strategies adapted from dementia care, with antidepressants being ineffective and the role of stimulant therapy needing further evaluation.

TI  - Non-invasive Brain Stimulation: Probing Intracortical Circuits and Improving Cognition in the Aging Brain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - The impact of cognitive aging on brain function and structure is complex, and the relationship between aging-related structural changes and cognitive function are not fully understood. Physiological and pathological changes to the aging brain are highly variable, making it difficult to estimate a cognitive trajectory with which to monitor the conversion to cognitive decline. Beyond the information on the structural and functional consequences of cognitive aging gained from brain imaging and neuropsychological studies, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can enable stimulation of the human brain in vivo, offering useful insights into the functional integrity of intracortical circuits using electrophysiology and neuromodulation. TMS measurements can be used to identify and monitor changes in cortical reactivity, the integrity of inhibitory and excitatory intracortical circuits, the mechanisms of long-term potentiation (LTP)/depression-like plasticity and central cholinergic function. Repetitive TMS and tDCS can be used to modulate neuronal excitability and enhance cortical function, and thus offer a potential means to slow or reverse cognitive decline. This review will summarize and critically appraise relevant literature regarding the use of TMS and tDCS to probe cortical areas affected by the aging brain, and as potential therapeutic tools to improve cognitive function in the aging population. Challenges arising from intra-individual differences, limited reproducibility, and methodological differences will be discussed.

TI  - Comparative efficacy of 5 non-pharmacological therapies for adults with post-stroke cognitive impairment: A Bayesian network analysis based on 55 randomized controlled trials
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Background: As a common sequela after stroke, cognitive impairment negatively impacts patients' activities of daily living and overall rehabilitation. Non-pharmacological therapies have recently drawn widespread attention for their potential in improving cognitive function. However, the optimal choice of non-pharmacological therapies for post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is still unclear. Hence, in this study, we compared and ranked 5 non-pharmacological therapies for PSCI with a Bayesian Network Meta-analysis (NMA), to offer a foundation for clinical treatment decision-making. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese Biomedical Medicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wangfang Database, and China Science and Technology Journal Database were searched from database inception to December 31, 2021, to collect Randomized Controlled Trials for PSCI. All of the studies were assessed (according to Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews) and then data were extracted by two researchers separately. Pairwise meta-analysis for direct comparisons was performed using Revman. NMA of Bayesian hierarchical model was performed by WinBUGS and ADDIS. STATA was used to construct network evidence plots and funnel plots. Results: A total of 55 trials (53 Two-arm trials and 2 Three-arm trials) with 3,092 individuals were included in this study. In the pair-wise meta-analysis, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VR), Computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CA), Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), and Acupuncture were superior to normal cognition training in terms of MoCA, MMSE, and BI outcomes. Bayesian NMA showed that the MoCA outcome ranked Acupuncture (84.7%) as the best therapy and TMS (79.7%) as the second. The MMSE outcome ranked TMS (76.1%) as the best therapy and Acupuncture as the second (72.1%). For BI outcome, TMS (89.1%) ranked the best. Conclusions: TMS and Acupuncture had a better effect on improving cognitive function in post-stroke patients according to our Bayesian NMA. However, this conclusion still needs to be confirmed with large sample size and high-quality randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Psychosis in Parkinson's Disease: Looking Beyond Dopaminergic Treatments
T2  - CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. The symptoms of PD are characterized not only by motor alterations but also by a spectrum of nonmotor symptoms. Some of these are psychiatric manifestations such as sleep disorders; depression; cognitive difficulties that can evolve into dementia; and symptoms of psychosis, which include hallucinations, illusions, and delusions. Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) occurs in 18-50% of patients with PD. Treating PDP is challenging because antipsychotic drugs tend to be inefficient or may even worsen the disease's motor symptoms. Objective: This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in PDP and recent innovative alternatives for its treatment. Methods: This is a narrative review in which an extensive literature search was performed on the Scopus, EMBASE, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases from inception to August 2021. The terms "Parkinson's disease psychosis", "Parkinson psychosis," "neurodegenerative psychosis", and "dopamine psychosis" were among the keywords used in the search. Results: Recently, views on the etiology of hallucinations and illusions have evolved remarkably. PDP has been cemented as a multifactorial entity dependent on extrinsic and novel intrinsic mechanisms, including genetic factors, neurostructural alterations, functional disruptions, visual processing disturbances, and sleep disorders. Consequently, innovative pharmacological and biological treatments have been proposed. Pimavanserin, a selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist, stands out after its approval to treat PDP-associated hallucinations and illusions. Conclusion: Future results from upcoming clinical trials should further characterize the role of this drug in the management of PDP as well as other treatment options with novel mechanisms of action, such as saracatinib, SEP-363856, cannabidiol, electroconvulsive therapy, and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

TI  - Targeting neuroplasticity in patients with neurodegenerative diseases using brain stimulation techniques
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL NEURODEGENERATION
AB  - Deficits in synaptic transmission and plasticity are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Several brain stimulation techniques are currently available to assess or modulate human neuroplasticity, which could offer clinically useful interventions as well as quantitative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In this review, we discuss several brain stimulation techniques, with a special emphasis on transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation (DBS), and review the results of clinical studies that applied these techniques to examine or modulate impaired neuroplasticity at the local and network levels in patients with AD or PD. The impaired neuroplasticity can be detected in patients at the earlier and later stages of both neurodegenerative diseases. However, current brain stimulation techniques, with a notable exception of DBS for PD treatment, cannot serve as adequate clinical tools to assist in the diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis of individual patients with AD or PD. Targeting the impaired neuroplasticity with improved brain stimulation techniques could offer a powerful novel approach for the treatment of AD and PD.

TI  - Managing Advanced Parkinson Disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY AND NEUROLOGY
AB  - Advanced Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with treatment-related motor fluctuations and reduced ability to perform activities of daily living. Progression of non-motor symptoms and medication-induced adverse effects complicate focused approach to motor symptom management, frequently accelerating reduced quality of life. It is thus critical for clinicians to consider disease progression versus therapeutic contributions when balancing management decisions. Such an approach requires careful recognition of inflection points resulting from therapeutic decisions and should prompt consideration of reduced pharmacologic burden and increased reliance on non-pharmacologic strategies in advanced disease. The successful approach to advanced PD requires a multidisciplinary effort focused on improving the patient's and family's quality of life, sometimes requiring sacrifice of motor symptom benefit. Here, we emphasize management strategies in advanced PD, focusing on the need to balance the therapeutic approach across advancing motor symptoms, progressive non-motor features, and potential pharmacologic adverse effects.

TI  - Neurophysiological insights into the pathophysiology of REM sleep behavior disorders: A review
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH
AB  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a clinical condition characterized by an intermittent or complete loss of muscle atonia and an increase of phasic muscular activity during REM sleep (or Stage R), leading to complex nocturnal motor behaviors. Correct and early diagnosis is important because RED may lead to serious injuries and is a well-treatable disorder. Since the characteristic electrophysiologic finding in patients with RBD is the increased electromyographic tone during REM sleep/Stage R, simultaneous video/polysomnography recording is essential for diagnosing this parasomnia. Moreover, several neurophysiological techniques have been used to improve our knowledge and understanding of this troubling sleep disorder. We reviewed the most important studies employing quantitative electroencephalography, event-related potentials, transcranial magnetic stimulation, brainstem reflexes and cortico-muscular coherence analysis. All these neurophysiological techniques have proven to provide a valuable tool to gain insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying RED. The review concludes with a brief discussion on the possible future implications for improving therapeutic approaches. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

TI  - Studies on magnetism and bioelectromagnetics for 45 years: From magnetic analog memory to human brain stimulation and imaging
T2  - BIOELECTROMAGNETICS
AB  - Forty-five years of studies on magnetism and bioelectromagnetics, in our laboratory, are presented. This article is prepared for the d'Arsonval Award Lecture. After a short introduction of our early work on magnetic analog memory, we review and discuss the following topics: (1) Magnetic nerve stimulation and localized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the human brain by figure-eight coils; (2) Measurements of weak magnetic fields generated from the brain by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) systems, called magnetoencephalography (MEG), and its application in functional brain studies; (3) New methods of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the imaging of impedance of the brain, called impedance MRI, and the imaging of neuronal current activities in the brain, called current MRI; (4) Cancer therapy and other medical treatments by pulsed magnetic fields; (5) Effects of static magnetic fields and magnetic control of cell orientation and cell growth; and (6) Effects of radio frequency magnetic fields and control of iron ion release and uptake from and into ferritins, iron cage proteins. These bioelectromagnetic studies have opened new horizons in magnetism and medicine, in particular for brain research and treatment of ailments such as depression, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases.

TI  - Rational pharmacological approaches for cognitive dysfunction and depression in Parkinson's disease
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is not a single entity but rather a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. The present study aims to conduct a critical systematic review of the literature to describe the main pharmacological strategies to treat cognitive dysfunction and major depressive disorder in PD patients. We performed a search of articles cited in PubMed from 2004 to 2014 using the following MeSH terms (Medical subject headings) "Parkinson disease"; "Delirium," "Dementia," "Amnestic," "Cognitive disorders," and "Parkinson disease"; "depression," "major depressive disorder," "drug therapy." We found a total of 71 studies related to pharmacological treatment in cognitive dysfunction and 279 studies for pharmacological treatment in major depressive disorder. After fulfillment of all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 articles remained for cognitive dysfunction and 11 for major depressive disorder, which are presented and discussed in this study. Further research into non-motor symptoms of PD may provide insights into mechanisms of neurodegeneration, and provide better quality of life by using rational drugs.

TI  - Depression in Patients with Parkinson's Disease: Current Understanding of its Neurobiology and Implications for Treatment
T2  - DRUGS & AGING
AB  - Depression is one of the most frequent and burdensome non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), across all stages. Even when its severity is mild, PD depression has a great impact on quality of life for these patients and their caregivers. Accordingly, accurate diagnosis, supported by validated scales, identification of risk factors, and recognition of motor and non-motor symptoms comorbid to depression are critical to understanding the neurobiology of depression, which in turn determines the effectiveness of dopaminergic drugs, antidepressants and non-pharmacological interventions. Recent advances using in vivo functional and structural imaging demonstrate that PD depression is underpinned by dysfunction of limbic networks and monoaminergic systems, depending on the stage of PD and its associated symptoms, including apathy, anxiety, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), cognitive impairment and dementia. In particular, the evolution of serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic dysfunction and abnormalities of limbic circuits across time, involving the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices, amygdala, thalamus and ventral striatum, help to delineate the variable expression of depression in patients with prodromal, early and advanced PD. Evidence is accumulating to support the use of dual serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (desipramine, nortriptyline, venlafaxine) in patients with PD and moderate to severe depression, while selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and cognitive behavioral therapy may also be considered. In all patients, recent findings advocate that optimization of dopamine replacement therapy and evaluation of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus to improve motor symptoms represents an important first step, in addition to physical activity. Overall, this review indicates that increasing understanding of neurobiological changes help to implement a roadmap of tailored interventions for patients with PD and depression, depending on the stage and comorbid symptoms underlying PD subtypes and their prognosis.

TI  - The Estimation of Utility Weights in Cost-Utility Analysis for Mental Disorders: A Systematic Review
T2  - PHARMACOECONOMICS
AB  - Objective To systematically review approaches and instruments used to derive utility weights in cost-utility analyses (CUAs) within the field of mental disorders and to identify factors that may have influenced the choice of the approach.
   Methods We searched the databases DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), NHS EED (National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database), HTA (Health Technology Assessment), and PubMed for CUAs. Studies were included if they were full economic evaluations and reported quality-adjusted life-years as the health outcome. Study characteristics and instruments used to estimate utility weights were described and a logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with the choice of either the direct (e.g. standard gamble) or the preference-based measure (PBM) approach (e.g. EQ-5D).
   Results We identified 227 CUAs with a maximum in 2009, 2010, and 2012. Most CUAs were conducted in depression, dementia, or psychosis, and came from the US or the UK, with the EQ-5D being the most frequently used instrument. The application of the direct approach was significantly associated with depression, psychosis, and model-based studies. The PBM approach was more likely to be used in recent studies, dementia, Europe, and empirical studies. Utility weights used in model-based studies were derived from only a small number of studies.
   Limitations We only searched four databases and did not evaluate the quality of the included studies.
   Conclusions Direct instruments and PBMs are used to elicit utility weights in CUAs with different frequencies regarding study type, mental disorder, and country.

TI  - Targeting neural correlates of placebo effects
T2  - COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE & BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Harnessing the placebo effects would prompt critical ramifications for research and clinical practice. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and multifocal transcranial electric stimulation, could manipulate the placebo response by modulating the activity and excitability of its neural correlates. To identify potential stimulation targets, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate placebo-associated regions in healthy volunteers, including studies with emotional components and painful stimuli. Using biophysical modeling, we identified NIBS solutions to manipulate placebo effects by targeting either a single key region or multiple connected areas. Moving to a network-oriented approach, we then ran a quantitative network mapping analysis on the functional connectivity profile of clusters emerging from the meta-analysis. As a result, we suggest a multielectrode optimized montage engaging the connectivity patterns of placebo-associated functional brain networks. These NIBS solutions hope to provide a starting point to actively control, modulate or enhance placebo effects in future clinical studies and cognitive enhancement studies.

TI  - Neuromodulation Treatments for Geriatric Mood and Cognitive Disorders
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - There is increasing evidence for the efficacy of neuromodulation in the treatment of resistant mood disorders and emerging data supporting the use of neuromodulation in cognitive disorders. A significant minority of depressed elders do not respond to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy. This has led clinicians to recommend the increasing use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the treatment of medication-resistant or life-threatening geriatric depression. Multiple studies have supported the safety and efficacy of ECT in the elderly, yet ECT is associated with side effects including cardiovascular and cognitive side effects. Neuromodulation therapies have the potential for providing effective treatment for treatment-resistant older adults with reduced side effects and this review will outline the risks and benefits of neuromodulation treatment in geriatric psychiatry. There is also emerging evidence of the efficacy of neuromodulation devices in the treatment of cognitive disorders. Pharmacotherapy has been largely ineffective in changing the course of neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia and other treatments are clearly needed. This review will outline the available evidence for neuromodulation in the treatment of mood and cognitive disorders in the elderly.

TI  - Neurophysiological Hallmarks of Neurodegenerative Cognitive Decline: The Study of Brain Connectivity as a Biomarker of Early Dementia
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
AB  - Neurodegenerative processes of various types of dementia start years before symptoms, but the presence of a "neural reserve", which continuously feeds and supports neuroplastic mechanisms, helps the aging brain to preserve most of its functions within the "normality" frame. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between dementia and normal brain aging. About 50% of MCI subjects are already in a stage that is prodromal-to-dementia and during the following 3 to 5 years will develop clinically evident symptoms, while the other 50% remains at MCI or returns to normal. If the risk factors favoring degenerative mechanisms are modified during early stages (i.e., in the prodromal), the degenerative process and the loss of abilities in daily living activities will be delayed. It is therefore extremely important to have biomarkers able to identify-in association with neuropsychological tests-prodromal-to-dementia MCI subjects as early as possible. MCI is a large (i.e., several million in EU) and substantially healthy population; therefore, biomarkers should be financially affordable, largely available and non-invasive, but still accurate in their diagnostic prediction. Neurodegeneration initially affects synaptic transmission and brain connectivity; methods exploring them would represent a 1st line screening. Neurophysiological techniques able to evaluate mechanisms of synaptic function and brain connectivity are attracting general interest and are described here. Results are quite encouraging and suggest that by the application of artificial intelligence (i.e., learning-machine), neurophysiological techniques represent valid biomarkers for screening campaigns of the MCI population.

TI  - Non-invasive transcranial brain modulation for neurological disorders treatment: A narrative review
T2  - LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Noninvasive brain stimulation/modulation is a rapidly emerging technique that has been implemented in different clinical applications. The commonly noninvasive techniques used in neurological manipulations include photobiomodulation (PBM), transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and ultrasound stimulation (USS). These techniques have the ability to excite, inhibit, or modulate neuronal activity in targeted brain areas to obtain the required therapeutic effects. However, each technique owns its unique mechanism of action that relies on specific parameters suitable for treating certain neurological disorders. Neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and depression have been treated by one or more of these noninvasive techniques. The therapeutic outcomes of these techniques for neurological diseases are promising, yet with limitations. In the present review, the mechanisms of action of these different brain stimulation/modulation modalities were explored and a synopsis of their applications in the treatment of certain neurological disorders was provided. Moreover, methodological issues, limitations, and open questions were presented. Furthermore, some future directions were suggested.

TI  - Human brain connectivity: Clinical applications for <i>clinical neurophysiology</i>
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - This manuscript is the second part of a two-part description of the current status of understanding of the network function of the brain in health and disease. We start with the concept that brain function can be understood only by understanding its networks, how and why information flows in the brain. The first manuscript dealt with methods for network analysis, and the current manuscript focuses on the use of these methods to understand a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Disorders considered are neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, movement disorders, including essential tremor, Parkinson disease, dystonia and apraxia, epilepsy, psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, and phantom limb pain. This state-of-the-art review makes clear the value of networks and brain models for understanding symptoms and signs of disease and can serve as a foundation for further work.

TI  - New modalities and directions for dystonia care
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION
AB  - Dystonia is an abnormal involuntary movement or posture owing to sustained or intermittent muscle contraction. Standard treatment for dystonia includes medications, such as levodopa, anticholinergic and antiepileptic drugs, botulinum toxin, and baclofen pump, and surgeries, such as lesioning surgery and deep-brain stimulation. New treatment modalities aimed toward improving dystonia care in the future are under investigation. There are two main axes to improve dystonia care; one is non-invasive neuromodulation, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. The other is a quantitative evaluation of dystonia using a wearable device and motion-capturing system, which can be empowered by artificial intelligence. In this article, the current status of these axes will be reviewed.

TI  - The scientific and clinical basis for the treatment of Parkinson disease (2009)
T2  - NEUROLOGY
AB  - Parkinson disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that affects as many as 1-2% of persons aged 60 years and older. With the aging of the population, the frequency of PD is expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades. Current therapy is largely based on a dopamine replacement strategy, primarily using the dopamine precursor levodopa. However, chronic treatment is associated with the development of motor complications, and the disease is inexorably progressive. Further, advancing disease is associated with the emergence of features such as freezing, falling, and dementia which are not adequately controlled with dopaminergic therapies. Indeed, it is now appreciated that these nondopaminergic features are common and the major source of disability for patients with advanced disease. Many different therapeutic agents and treatment strategies have been evaluated over the past several years to try and address these unmet medical needs, and many promising approaches are currently being tested in the laboratory and in the clinic. As a result, there are now many new therapies and strategic approaches available for the treatment of the different stages of PD, with which the treating physician must be familiar in order to provide patients with optimal care. This monograph provides an overview of the management of PD patients, with an emphasis on pathophysiology, and the results of recent clinical trials. It is intended to provide physicians with an understanding of the different treatment options that are available for managing the different stages of the disease and the scientific rationale of the different approaches.

TI  - Modulation of neurotrophic factors in the treatment of dementia, stroke and TBI: Effects of Cerebrolysin
T2  - MEDICINAL RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB  - Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are involved in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders such as dementia, stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI), and constitute molecular targets of high interest for the therapy of these pathologies. In this review we provide an overview of current knowledge of the definition, discovery and mode of action of five NTFs, nerve growth factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, brain derived NTF, vascular endothelial growth factor and tumor necrosis factor alpha; as well as on their contribution to brain pathology and potential therapeutic use in dementia, stroke and TBI. Within the concept of NTFs in the treatment of these pathologies, we also review the neuropeptide preparation Cerebrolysin, which has been shown to resemble the activities of NTFs and to modulate the expression level of endogenous NTFs. Cerebrolysin has demonstrated beneficial treatment capabilities in vitro and in clinical studies, which are discussed within the context of the biochemistry of NTFs. The review focuses on the interactions of different NTFs, rather than addressing a single NTF, by outlining their signaling network and by reviewing their effect on clinical outcome in prevalent brain pathologies. The effects of the interactions of these NTFs and Cerebrolysin on neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, angiogenesis and inflammation, and their relevance for the treatment of dementia, stroke and TBI are summarized.

TI  - Cortical influences drive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB  - The early motor manifestations of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), while rarely documented, reflect failure of adaptive complex motor skills. The development of these skills correlates with progressive evolution of a direct corticomotoneuronal system that is unique to primates and markedly enhanced in humans. The failure of this system in ALS may translate into the split hand presentation, gait disturbance, split leg syndrome and bulbar symptomatology related to vocalisation and breathing, and possibly diffuse fasciculation, characteristic of ALS. Clinical neurophysiology of the brain employing transcranial magnetic stimulation has convincingly demonstrated a presymptomatic reduction or absence of short interval intracortical inhibition, accompanied by increased intracortical facilitation, indicating cortical hyperexcitability. The hallmark of the TDP-43 pathological signature of sporadic ALS is restricted to cortical areas as well as to subcortical nuclei that are under the direct control of corticofugal projections. This provides anatomical support that the origins of the TDP-43 pathology reside in the cerebral cortex itself, secondarily in corticofugal fibres and the subcortical targets with which they make monosynaptic connections. The latter feature explains the multisystem degeneration that characterises ALS. Consideration of ALS as a primary neurodegenerative disorder of the human brain may incorporate concepts of prion-like spread at synaptic terminals of corticofugal axons. Further, such a concept could explain the recognised widespread imaging abnormalities of the ALS neocortex and the accepted relationship between ALS and frontotemporal dementia.

TI  - Toward personalized treatment of hallucinations
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Purpose of reviewHallucinations are common and often stressful experiences, occurring in all sensory modalities. They frequently complicate many disorders or situations, such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, hearing or vision loss, intoxications and delirium. Although psychoeducation, coping techniques and psychotherapy may be broadly applicable, they do not address a specific underlying brain mechanism. Pharmacotherapy may effectively alleviate hallucinations if the corresponding mechanism is present, whereas in its absence, may only cause harmful side effects. Therefore, pharmacotherapy needs input about underlying brain mechanisms.Recent findingsRecent findings suggest new underlying neurobiological mechanisms as possible therapeutic targets in selected patients, for example increased glutamate levels. In addition, neuronavigation can guide repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment of auditory verbal hallucinations to target-specific cortical regions.SummaryWe propose the use of neuroimaging methods to better understand the interaction of different mechanisms underlying hallucinations and to use this knowledge to guide pharmacotherapy or focal brain stimulation in a personalized manner. In addition, we suggest evidence from various imaging modalities should converge to answer a research question. We believe this convergence of evidence' avoids the problem of overreliance on single and isolated findings.

TI  - Toward noninvasive brain stimulation 2.0 in Alzheimer's disease
T2  - AGEING RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB  - Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques (NiBS) have gathered substantial interest in the study of dementia, considered their possible role in help defining diagnostic biomarkers of altered neural activity for early disease detection and monitoring of its pathophysiological course, as well as for their therapeutic potential of boosting residual cognitive functions. Nevertheless, current approaches suffer from some limitations. In this study, we review and discuss experimental NiBS applications that might help improve the efficacy of future NiBS uses in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), including perturbation-based biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease tracking, solutions to enhance synchronization of oscillatory electroencephalographic activity across brain networks, enhancement of sleep-related memory consolidation, image-guided stimulation for connectome control, protocols targeting interneuron pathology and protein clearance, and finally hybrid-brain models for in-silico modeling of AD pathology and personalized target selection. The present work aims to stress the importance of multidisciplinary, translational, model-driven interventions for precision medicine approaches in AD.

TI  - A Systematic Review of the Effectiveness of Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation Techniques to Reduce Violence Proneness by Interfering in Anger and Irritability
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - The field of neurocriminology has proposed several treatments (e.g., pharmacological, brain surgery, androgen-deprivation therapy, neurofeedback) to reduce violence proneness, but unfortunately, their effectiveness has been limited due to their side-effects. Therefore, it is necessary to explore alternative techniques to improve patients' behavioural regulation with minimal undesirable effects. In this regard, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, which are based on applying changing magnetic fields or electric currents to interfere with cortical excitability, have revealed their usefulness in alleviating the symptomatology of several mental disorders. However, to our knowledge, there are no reviews that assess whether these techniques are useful for reducing violence proneness. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria using the following databases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Dialnet, Psicodoc, Web of Knowledge, and the Cochrane Library. We initially identified 3746 entries, and eventually included 56 publications. Most of the studies were unanimous in concluding that the application of these techniques over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was not sufficient to promote anger and irritability reductions in euthymic individuals of both genders. Nevertheless, the application of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, especially transcranial direct current stimulation, over the right PFC seemed to reduce violent reactions in these individuals by interfering with the interpretation of the unfavourable situations (e.g., threating signals) or inner states that evoked anger. In antisocial and pathological populations, the conclusions were provided by a few pilot studies with important methodological weaknesses. The main conclusion of these studies was that bilateral stimulation of the PFC satisfactorily reduced anger and irritability only in inmates, patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), people who suffered a closed-head injury, and agitated patients with Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, combining these techniques with risperidone considerably reduced aggressiveness in these patients. Therefore, it is necessary to be cautious about the benefits of these techniques to control anger, due the methodological weaknesses of these studies. Nonetheless, they offer valuable opportunities to prevent violence by designing new treatments combining brain stimulation with current strategies, such as psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, in order to promote lasting changes.

TI  - Treatment of behavioural symptoms and dementia in Parkinson's disease
T2  - FUNDAMENTAL & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Behavioural symptoms such as anxiety, depression and psychosis are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), and dementia occurs in about 90% of the patients. These symptoms can be more disabling than the motor dysfunction and they negatively impact quality of life, increase caregiver distress and are more frequently associated with nursing home placement. Depression can be treated with counselling and pharmacotherapy. Tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are widely used, but there is still need for controlled clinical trials. Management of psychosis in PD is complex and includes elimination of identifiable risk factors, reduction of polypharmacy and administration of atypical neuroleptics, which can alleviate psychotic symptoms without worsening motor functions. Clozapine is the best documented atypical neuroleptic shown to be effective against psychosis in PD patients. Cholinesterase inhibitors may prove additional benefit in psychotic PD patients. Recent evidence from small double-blind and open-label trials suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors may be effective in the treatment of dementia associated with PD.

TI  - Update on Therapeutic Strategies for Atypical Parkinsonian Syndromes
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Atypical Parkinsonian syndromes include multiple systems atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). These conditions show signs of dopamine deficiency, but unlike Parkinson's disease (PD), they do not respond to dopaminergic treatments and usually have a worse outcome compared with idiopathic PD. The Atypical Parkinsonian syndromes have no specific treatment or cure. Up to now, there are just a few therapeutic approaches that place emphasis on symptomatic and supportive therapies. These approaches are based on palliative care, physical or occupational therapy, neuropsychology, speech pathology, psychiatry, and social works. Pharmacotherapy with levodopa, dopamine agonists, amantadine, co-enzyme Q10, botulinum toxin, cholinesterase inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may improve some symptoms of PSP and CBD. In this review, we categorize some of the recent studies on therapeutic strategies as follows: autologous transplantation of stem cells, deep transcranial magnetic stimulation, intravenous immunoglobulin, intranasal insulin, and pimavanserin. By classifying and comparing the most recent advances in treatment strategies of the atypical parkinsonian syndromes, we provide a benchmark for further studies to introduce new effective therapeutic methods.

TI  - Brain networks stimulation in dementia: insights from functional imaging
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review
   Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is increasingly used in the field of dementia as a therapeutic option; however, evidence of clinical efficacy is limited, and the mechanism of action remains unknown. This review summarizes how functional imaging could contribute to the design of targeted and effective NIBS interventions for dementia.
   Recent findings
   Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has largely contributed to understanding brain dysfunction in dementia by identifying disease-specific networks. Resting-state fMRI might inform on a number of factors critical for the conduction of effective NIBS trials, such as definition of stimulation paradigms and choice of the stimulation target. In addition, fMRI may contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of action of NIBS, and provide a tool to monitor treatment efficacy.
   Summary
   Functional imaging is a promising approach for the development of hypothesis-driven, targeted stimulation approaches in the field of dementia.

TI  - Exploring Nonmotor Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Parkinson Disease in a Comprehensive Care Setting
T2  - JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY AND NEUROLOGY
AB  - Parkinson disease (PD) is a debilitating neurological condition that includes both motor symptoms and nonmotor symptoms (NMS). Psychiatric complaints comprise NMS and are collectively referred to as neuropsychiatric manifestations. Common findings include atypical depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychosis, impulse control disorder, deterioration of cognition, and sleep disturbances. Quality of life (QoL) of patients suffering from NMS is greatly impacted and many times can be more debilitating than motor symptoms of PD. We expand on knowledge gained from treatment models within a comprehensive care model that incorporates multidisciplinary specialists working alongside psychiatrists to treat PD. Insight into background, clinical presentations, and treatment options for patients suffering from neuropsychiatric manifestations of PD are discussed. Identifying symptoms early can help improve QoL, provide early symptom relief, and can assist tailoring treatment plans that limit neuropsychiatric manifestations.

TI  - Impaired brain plasticity as a potential therapeutic target for treatment and prevention of dementia
T2  - EXPERT OPINION ON THERAPEUTIC TARGETS
AB  - Introduction: In 2017, it was estimated that close to 50 million people were living with dementia worldwide and this number is expected to double every 20 years. No effective treatment exists yet probably because by the time Alzheimer's dementia (AD) has developed it is too late to intervene. Areas covered: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical state that typically precedes AD. In MCI, the prefrontal cortex supports compensatory mechanisms that depend on robust synaptic plasticity and that delay progression to AD. This review focuses on novel neurostimulation approaches that could enhance prefrontal cortical plasticity in vivo by enhancing prefrontal cortical plasticity and function in patients with MCI or AD. It also describes novel neurophysiological markers that could function as targets for such approaches. Expert commentary: Targeting synaptic plasticity in patients with early AD or at risk of developing AD could be a promising approach to slow progression or prevent AD.

TI  - The effect of intermittent theta burst stimulation for cognitive dysfunction: a meta-analysis
T2  - BRAIN INJURY
AB  - BackgroundGrowing evidence suggests that cognitive dysfunction significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) has emerged as a potential intervention for cognitive dysfunction. However, consensus on the iTBS protocol for cognitive impairment is lacking.MethodsWe conducted searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database and the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database from their inception to January 2024. Random-effects meta-analyzes were used to calculate standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.ResultsTwelve studies involving 506 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis showed a trend toward improvement of total cognitive function, activities of daily living and P300 latency compared to sham stimulation in patients with cognitive dysfunction. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that these effects were restricted to patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment but not Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, subthreshold stimulation also exhibited a significant improvement.ConclusionsThe results suggest that iTBS may improve cognitive function in patients with cognitive dysfunction, although the quality of evidence remains low. Further studies with better methodological quality should explore the effects of iTBS on cognitive function.

TI  - The evolving role of surface electromyography in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A systematic review
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease that leads to inexorable motor decline and a median survival of three years from symptom onset. Surface EMG represents a major technological advance that has been harnessed in the development of novel neurophysiological biomarkers. We have systematically reviewed the current application of surface EMG techniques in ALS.
   Methods: We searched PubMed to identify 42 studies focusing on surface EMG and its associated analytical methods in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of ALS patients.
   Results: A wide variety of analytical techniques were identified, involving motor unit decomposition from high-density grids, motor unit number estimation and measurements of neuronal hyperexcitability or neuromuscular architecture. Some studies have proposed specific diagnostic and prognostic criteria however clinical calibration in large ALS cohorts is currently lacking. The most validated method to monitor disease is the motor unit number index (MUNIX), which has been implemented as an outcome measure in two ALS clinical trials.
   Conclusion: Surface EMG offers significant practical and analytical flexibility compared to invasive techniques. To capitalise on this fully, emphasis must be placed upon the multi-disciplinary collaboration of clinicians, bioengineers, mathematicians and biostatisticians. Significance: Surface EMG techniques can enrich effective biomarker development in ALS. (C) 2019 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Testing network properties of episodic memory using non-invasive brain stimulation
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
AB  - Episodic memory depends on the hippocampus and its coordination with a distributed network of interconnected brain areas. Recent findings indicate that the function of this network can be altered using network-targeted transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). These stimulation experiments have identified increases in episodic memory and the network-wide coordination it requires. Network-target stimulation the dominant framework for TMS experiments, in which stimulation is considered a focal virtual lesion. We offer a conceptual framework for important distinctions between network-wide and focal effects of stimulation on episodic memory and discuss factors that may influence the quality and quantity of stimulation effects. Findings from these experiments indicate that many properties of episodic memory can be effectively studied at the network level via noninvasive stimulation.

TI  - Neurophysiology of the "Celiac Brain": Disentangling Gut-Brain Connections
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Celiac disease (CD) can be considered a complex multi-organ disorder with highly variable extra-intestinal, including neurological, involvement. Cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, headache, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric diseases are complications frequently reported. These manifestations may be present at the onset of the typical disease or become clinically evident during its course. However, CD subjects with subclinical neurological involvement have also been described, as well as patients with clear central and/or peripheral nervous system and intestinal histopathological disease features in the absence of typical CD manifestations. Based on these considerations, a sensitive and specific diagnostic method that is able to detect early disease process, progression, and complications is desirable. In this context, neurophysiological techniques play a crucial role in the non-invasive assessment of central nervous system(CNS) excitability and conductivity. Moreover, some of these tools are known for their valuable role in early diagnosis and follow-up of several neurological diseases or systemic disorders, such as CD with nervous system involvement, even at the subclinical level. This review provides an up-to-date summary of the neurophysiological basis of CD using electroencephalography (EEG), multimodal evoked potentials, and transcranialmagnetic stimulation (TMS). The evidence examined here seems to converge on an overall profile of "hyperexcitable celiac brain," which partially recovers after institution of a gluten-free diet (GFD). The main translational correlate is that in case of subclinical neurological involvement or overt unexplained symptoms, neurophysiology could contribute to the diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring of a potentially underlying CD.

TI  - Brain imaging of locomotion in neurological conditions
T2  - NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Impaired locomotion is a frequent and major source of disability in patients with neurological conditions. Different neuroimaging methods have been used to understand the brain substrates of locomotion in various neurological diseases (mainly in Parkinson's disease) during actual walking, and while resting (using mental imagery of gait, or brain-behavior correlation analyses). These studies, using structural (i.e., MRI) or functional (i.e., functional MRI or functional near infra-red spectroscopy) brain imaging, electrophysiology (i.e., EEG), non-invasive brain stimulation (i.e., transcranial magnetic stimulation, or transcranial direct current stimulation) or molecular imaging methods (i.e., PET, or SPECT) reveal extended brain networks involving both grey and white matters in key cortical (i.e., prefrontal cortex) and subcortical (basal ganglia and cerebellum) regions associated with locomotion. However, the specific roles of the various pathophysiological mechanisms encountered in each neurological condition on the phenotype of gait disorders still remains unclear. After reviewing the results of individual brain imaging techniques across the common neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia, stroke, or multiple sclerosis, we will discuss how the development of new imaging techniques and computational analyses that integrate multivariate correlations in "large enough datasets" might help to understand how individual pathophysiological mechanisms express clinically as an abnormal gait. Finally, we will explore how these new analytic methods could drive our rehabilitative strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The clinical diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) relies on determination of progressive dysfunction of both cortical as well as spinal and bulbar motor neurons. However, the variable mix of upper and lower motor neuron signs result in the clinical heterogeneity of patients with ALS, resulting frequently in delay of diagnosis as well as difficulty in monitoring disease progression and treatment outcomes particularly in a clinical trial setting. As such, the present review provides an overview of recently developed novel non-invasive electrophysiological techniques that may serve as biomarkers to assess UMN and LMN dysfunction in ALS patients.

AB  - A continuous rise in life expectancy has led to an increase in the number of senior citizens, now amounting to a fifth of the global population, and to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of diseases of the elderly. This review discusses the threat of dementia, a disease that imposes enormous financial burden on health systems and warrants efficient therapeutic solutions. What we learned from numerous failed clinical trials is that we have to immediately take into account two major elements: early detection of dementia, much before the onset of symptoms, and personalized (precision) medicine treatment approach. We also discuss some of the most promising therapeutic directions, including stem cells, exosomes, electromagnetic fields, and ozone.

TI  - Sleep, Noninvasive Brain Stimulation, and the Aging Brain: Challenges and Opportunities
T2  - AGEING RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB  - As we age, sleep patterns undergo severe modifications of their micro and macrostructure, with an overall lighter and more fragmented sleep structure. In general, interventions targeting sleep represent an excellent opportunity not only to maintain life quality in the healthy aging population, but also to enhance cognitive performance and, when pathology arises, to potentially prevent/slow down conversion from e.g. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Sleep abnormalities are, in fact, one of the earliest recognizable biomarkers of dementia, being also partially responsible for a cascade of cortical events that worsen dementia pathophysiology, including impaired clearance systems leading to build-up of extracellular amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. In this context, Noninvasive Brain Stimulation (NiBS) techniques, such as transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), may help investigate the neural substrates of sleep, identify sleep-related pathology biomarkers, and ultimately help patients and healthy elderly individuals to restore sleep quality and cognitive performance. However, brain stimulation applications during sleep have so far not been fully investigated in healthy elderly cohorts, nor tested in AD patients or other related dementias. The manuscript discusses the role of sleep in normal and pathological aging, reviewing available evidence of NiBS applications during both wakefulness and sleep in healthy elderly individuals as well as in MCI/AD patients. Rationale and details for potential future brain stimulation studies targeting sleep alterations in the aging brain are discussed, including enhancement of cognitive performance, overall quality of life as well as protein clearance.

TI  - A narrative review on non-invasive stimulation of the cerebellum in neurological diseases
T2  - NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Importance The cerebellum plays an important role in motor, cognitive, and affective functions owing to its dense interconnections with basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. This review aimed at summarizing the non-invasive cerebellar stimulation (NICS) approaches used to modulate cerebellar output and treat cerebellar dysfunction in the motor domain. Observation The utility of NICS in the treatment of cerebellar and non-cerebellar neurological diseases (including Parkinson's disease, dementia, cerebellar ataxia, and stroke) is discussed. NICS induces meaningful clinical effects from repeated sessions alone in both cerebellar and non-cerebellar diseases. However, there are no conclusive data on this issue and several concerns need to be still addressed before NICS could be considered a valuable, standard therapeutic tool. Conclusions and relevance Even though some challenges must be overcome to adopt NICS in a wider clinical setting, this tool might become a useful strategy to help patients with lesions in the cerebellum and cerebral areas that are connected with the cerebellum whether one could enhance cerebellar activity with the intention of facilitating the cerebellum and the entire, related network, rather than attempting to facilitate a partially damaged cortical region or inhibiting the homologs' contralateral area. The different outcome of each approach would depend on the residual functional reserve of the cerebellum, which is confirmed as a critical element to be probed preliminary in order to define the best patient-tailored NICS.

TI  - Non-invasive Brain Stimulation in the Treatment of Post-stroke and Neurodegenerative Aphasia: Parallels, Differences, and Lessons Learned
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Numerous studies over the span of more than a decade have shown that non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, namely transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), can facilitate language recovery for patients who have suffered from aphasia due to stroke. While stroke is the most common etiology of aphasia, neurodegenerative causes of language impairment collectively termed primary progressive aphasia (PPA)-are increasingly being recognized as important clinical phenotypes in dementia. Very limited data now suggest that (NIBS) may have some benefit in treating PPAs. However, before applying the same approaches to patients with PRA as have previously been pursued in patients with post-stroke aphasia, it will be important for investigators to consider key similarities and differences between these aphasia etiologies that is likely to inform successful approaches to stimulation. While both post stroke aphasia and the PPAs have clear overlaps in their clinical phenomenology, the mechanisms of injury and theorized neuroplastic changes associated with the two etiologies are notably different. Importantly, theories of plasticity in post-stroke aphasia are largely predicated on the notion that regions of the brain that had previously been uninvolved in language processing may take on new compensatory roles. PPAs, however, are characterized by slow distributed degeneration of cellular units within the language system; compensatory recruitment of brain regions to subserve language is not currently understood to be an important aspect of the condition. This review will survey differences in the mechanisms of language representation between the two etiologies of aphasia and evaluate properties that may define and limit the success of different neuromodulation approaches for these two disorders.

TI  - Motor neuron disease: current management and future prospects
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE JOURNAL
AB  - Motor neuron disease (MND) is characterised by progressive neurological deterioration and coexistence of upper and lower motor neuron signs. Over the past decade, evidence has emerged of unique pathophysiological processes, including glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, which has resulted in the development of novel diagnostic investigations and uncovered potential therapeutic targets. Advances in genetics, including the recently discovered C9orf72 gene, have radically changed the pathological mindset, from MND being classified as a neuromuscular disease to one that MND forms a continuum with other primary neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia. The present review will highlight the improvements that have occurred in clinical care, in conjunction with recent scientific developments.

TI  - Dystonia in corticobasal degeneration: A review of the literature on 404 pathologically proven cases
T2  - MOVEMENT DISORDERS
AB  - Dystonia is considered one of the classical features of corticobasal degeneration and is reported in up to 83% in clinical, not pathologically confirmed, series. Here, we aimed to establish the frequency and the clinical characteristics of dystonia in CBD by reviewing the literature on 404 pathologically proven cases. Further, we aimed to identify the frequency and characteristics of dystonia in all described phenotypes with CBD pathology. Dystonia was present in only 37.5% of the 296 cases with adequate information. The majority of the cases with dystonia presented with a corticobasal syndrome, and dystonia occurred in the first 2 years from disease onset, affecting the upper limb. In cases with dystonia that presented with a dementia phenotype, dystonia tended to appear later in the disease course and to more affect the cervical region and the face. With regard to the distribution of the phenotypes, fifty-four percent of 374 cases presented as corticobasal syndrome, 15% as frontotemporal dementia, and 10.7% as progressive supranuclear palsy. Dystonia and myoclonus were present in about half of all cases with corticobasal syndrome, implying that these features may not be as frequent in corticobasal syndrome as are akinetic-rigid syndrome and apraxia (100% and 86.3%, respectively). Dystonia and myoclonus almost co-occurred in our analysis, suggesting a possible association. In conclusion, despite dystonia being an inclusion criterion in all sets of clinical criteria for corticobasal degeneration, this was present in only one third of the pathologically proven cases presented here. More accurate characterization of dystonia in corticobasal degeneration would be of importance for clinical diagnosis and development of treatment strategies. (C) 2012 Movement Disorder Society

TI  - The inferior, anterior temporal lobes and semantic memory clarified: Novel evidence from distortion-corrected fMRI
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA
AB  - The neural basis of semantic memory generates considerable debate. Semantic dementia results from bilateral anterior temporal lobe (ATL) atrophy and gives rise to a highly specific impairment of semantic memory, suggesting that this region is a critical neural substrate for semantic processing. Recent rTMS experiments with neurologically-intact participants also indicate that the ATL are a necessary substrate for semantic memory. Exactly which regions within the ATL are important for semantic memory are difficult to detect from these methods (because the damage in SD covers a large part of the ATL). Functional neuroimaging might provide important clues about which specific areas exhibit activation that correlates with normal semantic performance. Neuroimaging studies, however, have not consistently found anterior temporal lobe activation in semantic tasks. A recent meta-analysis indicates that this inconsistency may be due to a collection of technical limitations associated with previous studies, including a reduced field-of-view and magnetic susceptibility artefacts associated with standard gradient echo fMRI. We conducted an fMRI study of semantic memory using a combination of techniques which improve sensitivity to ATL activations whilst preserving whole-brain coverage. As expected from SD patients and ATL rTMS experiments, this method revealed bilateral temporal activation extending from the inferior temporal lobe along the fusiform gyrus to the anterior temporal regions, bilaterally. We suggest that the inferior, anterior temporal lobe region makes a crucial contribution to semantic cognition and utilising this version of fMRI will enable further research on the semantic role of the ATL.

TI  - Apraxia: Review and Update
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROLOGY
AB  - Praxis, the ability to perform skilled or learned movements is essential for daily living. Inability to perform such praxis movements is defined as apraxia. Apraxia can be further classified into subtypes such as ideomotor, ideational and limb-kinetic apraxia. Relevant brain regions have been found to include the motor, premotor, temporal and parietal cortices. Apraxia is found in a variety of highly prevalent neurological disorders including dementia, stroke and Parkinson ism. Furthermore, apraxia has been shown to negatively affect quality of life. Therefore, recognition and treatment of this disorder is critical. This article provides an overview of apraxia and highlights studies dealing with the neurophysiology of this disorder, opening up novel perspectives for the use of motor training and noninvasive brain stimulation as treatment.

TI  - Disrupting the brain to validate hypotheses on the neurobiology of language
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Comprehension of words is an important part of the language faculty, involving the joint activity of frontal and temporo-parietal brain regions. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) enables the controlled perturbation of brain activity, and thus offers a unique tool to test specific predictions about the causal relationship between brain regions and language understanding. This potential has been exploited to better define the role of regions that are classically accepted as part of the language-semantic network. For instance, TMS has contributed to establish the semantic relevance of the left anterior temporal lobe, or to solve the ambiguity between the semantic vs. phonological function assigned to the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). We consider, more closely, the results from studies where the same technique, similar paradigms (lexical-semantic tasks) and materials (words) have been used to assess the relevance of regions outside the classically-defined language-semantic network-i.e., precentral motor regions-for the semantic analysis of words. This research shows that different aspects of the left precentral gyrus (primary motor and premotor sites) are sensitive to the action-non action distinction of words' meanings. However, the behavioral changes due to TMS over these sites are incongruent with what is expected after perturbation of a task-relevant brain region. Thus, the relationship between motor activity and language-semantic behavior remains far from clear. A better understanding of this issue could be guaranteed by investigating functional interactions between motor sites and semantically-relevant regions.

TI  - Pathophysiological Underpinnings of Extra-Motor Neurodegeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: New Insights From Biomarker Studies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) lie at opposing ends of a clinical, genetic, and neuropathological continuum. In the last decade, it has become clear that cognitive and behavioral changes in patients with ALS are more frequent than previously recognized. Significantly, these non-motor features can impact the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of ALS. Partially overlapping neuropathological staging systems have been proposed to describe the distribution of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregates outside the corticospinal tract. However, the relationship between TDP-43 inclusions and neurodegeneration is not absolute and other pathophysiological processes, such as neuroinflammation (with a prominent role of microglia), cortical hyperexcitability, and synaptic dysfunction also play a central role in ALS pathophysiology. In the last decade, imaging and biofluid biomarker studies have revealed important insights into the pathophysiological underpinnings of extra-motor neurodegeneration in the ALS-FTLD continuum. In this review, we first summarize the clinical and pathophysiological correlates of extra-motor neurodegeneration in ALS. Next, we discuss the diagnostic and prognostic value of biomarkers in ALS and their potential to characterize extra-motor neurodegeneration. Finally, we debate about how biomarkers could improve the diagnosis and classification of ALS. Emerging imaging biomarkers of extra-motor neurodegeneration that enable the monitoring of disease progression are particularly promising. In addition, a growing arsenal of biofluid biomarkers linked to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation are improving the diagnostic accuracy and identification of patients with a faster progression rate. The development and validation of biomarkers that detect the pathological aggregates of TDP-43 in vivo are notably expected to further elucidate the pathophysiological underpinnings of extra-motor neurodegeneration in ALS. Novel biomarkers tracking the different aspects of ALS pathophysiology are paving the way to precision medicine approaches in the ALS-FTLD continuum. These are essential steps to improve the diagnosis and staging of ALS and the design of clinical trials testing novel disease-modifying treatments.

TI  - The function of the anterior temporal lobe: A review of the empirical evidence
T2  - BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Recent work on the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) has lead to substantively different theoretical branches, of its putative functions, that have in some part developed independently of one another. The ATL has dense connectivity with a number of sensory modalities. This has resulted in empirical evidence that supports different functionality dependent upon the variables under investigation. The main bodies of evidence have implicated the ATL as a domain-general semantic hub, whilst other evidence points to a domain-specific role in social or 'person-related' processing. A third body of evidence suggests that the ATLs underlie processing of unique entities. Primarily, research of the ATL has been based on lesion studies and from clinical populations such as semantic dementia or temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Although important, this neuropsychological evidence has a number of confounds, therefore techniques such as functional neuroimaging on healthy participants and the relatively novel use of non-invasive brain stimulation may be more useful to isolate specific variables that can discriminate between these different theories concerning 'normal' function. This review focuses on these latter types of studies and considers the empirical evidence for each perspective. The overall literature is integrated in an attempt to formulate a unifying theory and the functional sub-regions within the ATL are explored. It is concluded that a holistic integration of the theories is feasible in that the ATLs could process domain-general semantic knowledge but with a bias towards social information or stimuli that is personally relevant. Thus, it may be the importance of social/emotional information that gives it priority of processing in the ATL not an inherent property of the structure itself. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Neuromodulation for restoring memory
T2  - NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS
AB  - Disorders of learning and memory have a large social and economic impact in today's society. Unfortunately, existing medical treatments have shown limited clinical efficacy or potential for modification of the disease course. Deep brain stimulation is a successful treatment for movement disorders and has shown promise in a variety of other diseases including psychiatric disorders. The authors review the potential of neuromodulation for the treatment of disorders of learning and memory. They briefly discuss learning circuitry and its involvement in Alzheimer disease and traumatic brain injury. They then review the literature supporting various targets for neuromodulation to improve memory in animals and humans. Multiple targets including entorhinal cortex, fornix, nucleus basalis of Meynert, basal ganglia, and pedunculopontine nucleus have shown a promising potential for improving dysfunctional memory by mechanisms such as altering firing patterns in neuronal networks underlying memory and increasing synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. Significant work remains to be done to translate these findings into durable clinical therapies.

TI  - Use of antidepressants in unipolar depression in the elderly
T2  - ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE
AB  - Objective. - To study the ageing-related pharmacological modifications about major depressive episodes in the elderly and their impact on the efficiency and tolerability of antidepressants.
   Methods. - Research through Pubmed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, using the following keywords "antidepressant" ; "treatment"; "late life depression"; "elderly"; up until July 2021.
   Results. - Antidepressants were found to be more efficient than a placebo in the elderly's response to and remission from major depressive episodes. Some depressive episode subtypes seem to be less responsive to antidepressants, such as depressive episodes of vascular origin, for which treating cardiovascular risk factors by statins, angiotensin receptor blockers or calcium channel blockers seems relevant. Two other depressive episode subtypes were highlighted : post-stroke depressive episodes and those induced by major neurocognitive disorders. Antidepressants showed an efficient response in the first case but not in the second. Even though antidepressants are known to stimulate cognitive performances in animals, as yet there is not sufficient evidence to prove they indeed improve cognitive functions, or reduce the risk of developing a neurocognitive disorder, or decelerate the cognitive decline in major neurocognitive disorders in humans. Ageing creates pharmacodynamical changes that increase older people's vulnerability to the side effects of antidepressants. Moreover, age-related pharmacokinetic modifications can also change every step in a drug's transformation process in the body, which leads to a high probability of having adverse effects. Since most antidepressants are eliminated using the P450 cytochrome system, their dosage must be adapted to changes of the P450 system. Somatic comorbidities can, in themselves, influence the pharmacokinetics of antidepressants. Many antidepressants interact with the P450 cytochrome and the P-GP protein, which puts them at a high risk of drug interactions. There is no proven efficiency difference between antidepressant classes. Some antidepressant adverse effects can be of particular importance in the elderly, like the risk of bleeding, cardiovascular episodes, hyponatremia, falling and fractures, anticholinergic effects, extrapyramidal syndrome, epilepsy, liver disease and death. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have an indication as the first line of treatment, avoiding paroxetine and fluoxetine. Serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors are relevant if the patient presents psychomotor retardation or pain, while keeping in mind to check blood pressure. Tricyclics and mono -amine oxidase inhibitors should be avoided because of their anticholinergic effects. Bupropion can be prescribed if the patient has extreme fatigue. Mirtazapine is useful when the patient presents sleep or appetite disturbance. Several molecules can be used in the case of drug-resistant depression, such as associating aripiprazole with small-dosage antidepressants, or electroconvulsive therapy, or repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). Ketamine and psychostimulants seem to have antidepressant effects, but complementary studies are needed to conclude.
   Conclusions. - Unipolar major depressive episodes in the elderly are frequent and their medicinal treatment has specific features. Knowing the specificities of antidepressant use in the elderly allows to optimize its efficiency and to limit the risk of inappropriate prescription leading to harmful adverse effects.

TI  - Language Network Dysfunction and Formal Thought Disorder in Schizophrenia
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN
AB  - Background Pathophysiological inquiries into schizophrenia require a consideration of one of its most defining features: disorganization and impoverishment in verbal behavior. This feature, often captured using the term Formal Thought Disorder (FTD), still remains to be one of the most poorly understood and understudied dimensions of schizophrenia. In particular, the large-scale network level dysfunction that contributes to FTD remains obscure to date. Study Design In this narrative review, we consider the various challenges that need to be addressed for us to move towards mapping FTD (construct) to a brain network level account (circuit). Study Results The construct-to-circuit mapping goal is now becoming more plausible than it ever was, given the parallel advent of brain stimulation and the tools providing objective readouts of human speech. Notwithstanding this, several challenges remain to be overcome before we can decisively map the neural basis of FTD. We highlight the need for phenotype refinement, robust experimental designs, informed analytical choices, and present plausible targets in and beyond the Language Network for brain stimulation studies in FTD. Conclusions Developing a therapeutically beneficial pathophysiological model of FTD is a challenging endeavor, but holds the promise of improving interpersonal communication and reducing social disability in schizophrenia. Addressing the issues raised in this review will be a decisive step in this direction.

TI  - The Role of Cognitive Reserve in Alzheimer's Disease and Aging: A Multi-Modal Imaging Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Comforts in modern society have generally been associated with longer survival rates, enabling individuals to reach advanced age as never before in history. With the increase in longevity, however, the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease, has also doubled. Nevertheless, most of the observed variance, in terms of time of clinical diagnosis and progression, often remains striking. Only recently, differences in the social, educational and occupational background of the individual, as proxies of cognitive reserve (CR), have been hypothesized to play a role in accounting for such discrepancies. CR is a well-established concept in literature; lots of studies have been conducted in trying to better understand its underlying neural substrates and associated biomarkers, resulting in an incredible amount of data being produced. Here, we aimed to summarize recent relevant published work addressing the issue, gathering evidence for the existence of a common path across research efforts that might ease future investigations by providing a general perspective on the actual state of the arts. An innovative model is hereby proposed, addressing the role of CR across structural and functional evidences, as well as the potential implementation of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in the causal validation of such theoretical frame.

AB  - Leukoaraiosis is a common imaging marker of cerebral small vessel disease. In recent years, with the continuous advances in brain imaging technology, the detection rate of leukoaraiosis is higher and its clinical subtypes are gradually gaining attention. Although leukoaraiosis has long been considered an incidental finding with no therapeutic necessity, there is now growing evidence linking it to, among other things, cognitive impairment and a high risk of death after stroke. Due to different research methods, some of the findings are inconsistent and even contradictory. Therefore, a comprehensive and in-depth study of risk factors for leukoaraiosis is of great clinical significance. In this review, we summarize the literature on leukoaraiosis in recent years with the aim of elucidating the disease in terms of various aspects (including pathogenesis, imaging features, and clinical features, etc.).

TI  - Direct Electrical Stimulation in Electrocorticographic Brain-Computer Interfaces: Enabling Technologies for Input to Cortex
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Electrocorticographic brain computer interfaces (ECoG-BCIs) offer tremendous opportunities for restoring function in individuals suffering from neurological damage and for advancing basic neuroscience knowledge. ECoG electrodes are already commonly used clinically for monitoring epilepsy and have greater spatial specificity in recording neuronal activity than techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG). Much work to date in the field has focused on using ECoG signals recorded from cortex as control outputs for driving end effectors. An equally important but less explored application of an ECoG-BCI is directing input into cortex using ECoG electrodes for direct electrical stimulation (DES). Combining DES with ECoG recording enables a truly bidirectional BCI, where information is both read from and written to the brain. We discuss the advantages and opportunities, as well as the barriers and challenges presented by using DES in an ECoG-BCI. In this article, we review ECoG electrodes, the physics and physiology of DES, and the use of electrical stimulation of the brain for the clinical treatment of disorders such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. We briefly discuss some of the translational, regulatory, financial, and ethical concerns regarding ECoG-BCIs. Next, we describe the use of ECoG-based DES for providing sensory feedback and for probing and modifying cortical connectivity. We explore future directions, which may draw on invasive animal studies with penetrating and surface electrodes as well as non-invasive stimulation methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We conclude by describing enabling technologies, such as smaller ECoG electrodes for more precise targeting of cortical areas, signal processing strategies for simultaneous stimulation and recording, and computational modeling and algorithms for tailoring stimulation to each individual brain.

TI  - Treatment of Apathy in Parkinson's Disease and Implications for Underlying Pathophysiology
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB  - Apathy is a prevalent and highly debilitating non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) that is often overlooked in clinical practice due to its subtle nature. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence for the treatment of apathy in PD, highlighting recent advancements and emerging therapeutic avenues. In this review, we analyse a diverse array of treatment strategies for apathy in PD, including pharmacological interventions, non-pharmacological approaches, and emerging neuromodulation techniques. We evaluate the efficacy, safety, and limitations of established pharmacotherapies, such as dopaminergic agents, antidepressants, and cognitive enhancers. Additionally, we examine the promising role of non-pharmacological interventions, encompassing psychotherapies and behavioural interventions, in ameliorating apathetic symptoms. Furthermore, this review explores the effects of neuromodulation techniques on apathy, including the modulation of apathy via deep brain stimulation and emerging data on the potential influence of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on apathy in PD. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of effective treatment strategies for apathy has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life and overall well-being of individuals living with PD.

AB  - Decrease in cognitive function is one of the most common causes of poor life quality and early disability in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Existing methods of treatment are aimed at both correction of motor and non-motor symptoms. Methods of adjuvant therapy (or complementary therapy) for maintaining cognitive functions in patients with PD are of interest. A promising subject of research in this regard is the method of transcranial electric current stimulation (tES). Here we reviewed the current understanding of the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in PD and of the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial alternating current stimulation on the cognitive function of patients with PD-MCI (Parkinson's Disease-Mild Cognitive Impairment).

TI  - Disease-Modifying Effects of Non-Invasive Electroceuticals on β-Amyloid Plaques and Tau Tangles for Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Electroceuticals refer to various forms of electronic neurostimulators used for therapy. Interdisciplinary advances in medical engineering and science have led to the development of the electroceutical approach, which involves therapeutic agents that specifically target neural circuits, to realize precision therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date, extensive studies have attempted to elucidate the disease-modifying effects of electroceuticals on areas in the brain of a patient with AD by the use of various physical stimuli, including electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic waves as well as ultrasound. Herein, we review non-invasive stimulatory systems and their effects on beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, which are pathological molecular markers of AD. Therefore, this review will aid in better understanding the recent technological developments, applicable methods, and therapeutic effects of electronic stimulatory systems, including transcranial direct current stimulation, 40-Hz gamma oscillations, transcranial magnetic stimulation, electromagnetic field stimulation, infrared light stimulation and ionizing radiation therapy, and focused ultrasound for AD.

TI  - Transcranial brain stimulation studies of episodic memory in young adults, elderly adults and individuals with memory dysfunction: A review
T2  - BRAIN STIMULATION
AB  - Transcranial magnetic and electric stimulation studies examining episodic memory in young participants have established the role of the left prefrontal cortex during encoding and the right prefrontal cortex during episodic retrieval. Furthermore, these techniques have been used to verify the reduction in functional asymmetry in the prefrontal cortex that occurs with ageing, at least during encoding, suggesting the existence of compensatory adjustments for the structural and neurotransmitter loss that occurs with physiological ageing. Nevertheless, it has been shown that several factors can modulate performance based on the type of material or strategy used. It is important to note that although numerous studies have addressed the role of the prefrontal cortex in episodic memory, a number of studies have also demonstrated the involvement of a more distributed neural network sustaining this function involving the temporal lobes and parietal cortices. Finally, it is evident that the use of transcranial stimulation techniques might represent a powerful tool not only for investigating the involvement of cerebral areas in a specific cognitive task but also for designing interventional therapies for individuals with memory impairment.

TI  - Things you wanted to know (but might have been afraid to ask) about how and why to explore and modulate brain plasticity with non-invasive neurostimulation technologies
T2  - REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE
AB  - Brain plasticity can be defined as the ability of local and extended neural systems to organize either the structure and/or the function of their connectivity patterns to better adapt to changes of our inner/outer environment and optimally respond to new challenging beha-vioral demands. Plasticity has been traditionally conceived as a spontaneous phenomenon naturally occurring during pre and postnatal development, tied to learning and memory processes, or enabled following neural damage and their rehabilitation. Such effects can be easily observed and measured but remain hard to harness or to tame 'at will'. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) technologies offer the possibility to engage plastic phenomena, and use this ability to characterize the relationship between brain regions, networks and their functional connectivity patterns with cognitive process or disease symptoms, to estimate cortical malleability, and ultimately contribute to neuropsychiatric therapy and rehabilita-tion. NIBS technologies are unique tools in the field of fundamental and clinical research in humans. Nonetheless, their abilities (and also limitations) remain rather unknown and in the hands of a small community of experts, compared to widely established methods such as functional neuroimaging (fMRI) or electrophysiology (EEG, MEG). In the current review, we first introduce the features, mechanisms of action and operational principles of the two most widely used NIBS methods, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Transcranial Current Stimulation (tCS), for exploratory or therapeutic purposes, emphasizing their bearings on neural plasticity mechanisms. In a second step, we walk the reader through two examples of recent domains explored by our team to further emphasize the potential and limitations of NIBS to either explore or improve brain function in healthy individuals and neuropsychiatric populations. A final outlook will identify a series of future topics of interest that can foster progress in the field and achieve more effective manipulation of brain plasticity and interventions to explore and improve cognition and treat the symptoms of neuropsychiatric diseases.# 2022 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields stimulation modulates autoimmunity and immune responses: a possible immuno-modulatory therapeutic effect in neurodegenerative diseases
T2  - NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH
AB  - Increasing evidence shows that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) stimulation is able to exert a certain action on autoimmunity and immune cells. In the past, the efficacy of pulsed ELF-EMFs in alleviating the symptoms and the progression of multiple sclerosis has been supported through their action on neurotransmission and on the autoimmune mechanisms responsible for demyelination. Regarding the immune system, ELF-EMF exposure contributes to a general activation of macrophages, resulting in changes of autoimmunity and several immunological reactions, such as increased reactive oxygen species-formation, enhanced phagocytic activity and increased production of chemokines. Transcranial electromagnetic brain stimulation is a non-invasive novel technique used recently to treat different neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Alzheimer's disease. Despite its proven value, the mechanisms through which EMF brain-stimulation exerts its beneficial action on neuronal function remains unclear. Recent studies have shown that its beneficial effects may be due to a neuroprotective effect on oxidative cell damage. On the basis of in vitro and clinical studies on brain activity, modulation by ELF-EMFs could possibly counteract the aberrant pro-inflammatory responses present in neurodegenerative disorders reducing their severity and their onset. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the published literature on EMFs and outline the most promising effects of ELF-EMFs in developing treatments of neurodegenerative disorders. In this regard, we review data supporting the role of ELF-EMF in generating immune-modulatory responses, neuromodulation, and potential neuroprotective benefits. Nonetheless, we reckon that the underlying mechanisms of interaction between EMF and the immune system are still to be completely understood and need further studies at a molecular level.

TI  - Huntington's Disease: The Value of Transcranial Meganetic Stimulation
T2  - CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative process whose etiology is based on a localized disturbance in the short arm of chromosome 4 that encodes the huntingtin protein (Htt). The elongation of triple CAG for glutamine characterizes this change. Mutated Htt (mHtt) causes the appearance of intracellular aggregates inducing alterations in mitochondrial metabolism in the form of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ATP depletion. The oxidative imbalance caused by mHtt leads the neurons to a state of oxidative stress resulting in damage to macromolecules and cellular death. Since the discovery of certain mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of HD, several therapeutic procedures have been shown to delay or slow the evolution of the condition and have demonstrated the biochemical and molecular mechanism involved. The studies have reported that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may improve motor and other symptoms associated with neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric processes such as major depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy, neuropathic pain, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive muscle atrophy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or HD. This study focuses on the effect of TMS on oxidative stress and neurogenesis in studies and its possible usefulness in HD.

TI  - Involvement of the Left Supramarginal Gyrus in Manipulation Judgment Tasks: Contributions to Theories of Tool Use
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB  - Objectives: Two theories of tool use, namely the gesture engram and the technical reasoning theories, make distinct predictions about the involvement of the left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) in manipulation judgement tasks. The objective here is to test these alternative predictions based on previous studies on manipulation judgment tasks using transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMS) targeting the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG). Methods: We review recent TMS studies on manipulation judgement tasks and confront these data with predictions made by both tool use theories. Results: The left SMG is a highly intertwined region, organized following several functionally distinct areas and TMS may have disrupted a cortical network involved in the ability to use tools rather than only one functional area supporting manipulation knowledge. Moreover, manipulation judgement tasks may be impaired following virtual lesions outside the IPL. Conclusions: These data are more in line with the technical reasoning hypothesis, which assumes that the left IPL does not store manipulation knowledge per se.

TI  - On closed-loop brain stimulation systems for improving the quality of life of patients with neurological disorders
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Emerging brain technologies have significantly transformed human life in recent decades. For instance, the closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI) is an advanced software-hardware system that interprets electrical signals from neurons, allowing communication with and control of the environment. The system then transmits these signals as controlled commands and provides feedback to the brain to execute specific tasks. This paper analyzes and presents the latest research on closed-loop BCI that utilizes electric/magnetic stimulation, optogenetic, and sonogenetic techniques. These techniques have demonstrated great potential in improving the quality of life for patients suffering from neurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases. We provide a comprehensive and systematic review of research on the modalities of closed-loop BCI in recent decades. To achieve this, the authors used a set of defined criteria to shortlist studies from well-known research databases into categories of brain stimulation techniques. These categories include deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct-current stimulation, transcranial alternating-current stimulation, and optogenetics. These techniques have been useful in treating a wide range of disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, dementia, and depression. In total, 76 studies were shortlisted and analyzed to illustrate how closed-loop BCI can considerably improve, enhance, and restore specific brain functions. The analysis revealed that literature in the area has not adequately covered closed-loop BCI in the context of cognitive neural prosthetics and implanted neural devices. However, the authors demonstrate that the applications of closed-loop BCI are highly beneficial, and the technology is continually evolving to improve the lives of individuals with various ailments, including those with sensory-motor issues or cognitive deficiencies. By utilizing emerging techniques of stimulation, closed-loop BCI can safely improve patients' cognitive and affective skills, resulting in better healthcare outcomes.

TI  - Short-afferent inhibition and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: A quantitative review and challenges
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB  - Traditionally, Parkinson's disease (PD) has been considered a single neurotransmitter (dopaminergic) disease. However, research over the past 20 years has shed light on the involvement of multiple neurotransmission systems, in particular, the cholinergic system. Research has mainly focused on the role of this system in the pathophysiology of PD and its implications in the development of motor and non-motor disorders. Short-latency sensory afferent inhibition (SAI), investigates sensori-motor integration, and has emerged as a putative neurophysiological marker of cholinergic function in the human brain. In this quantitative review, a moderate-to-severe reduction in SAI was observed in PD patients. Furthermore, through moderator analysis, the impairment of SAI was shown to be associated with disease duration and therapeutic state. Patients under dopaminergic agents ("on" state) displayed worse SAI than those after dopaminergic agent withdrawal ("off"). We further assess the potential value of SAI as a marker of cognitive impairment in PD, and its association with four specific cognitive domains. This analysis revealed that patients with cognitive impairment displayed significantly lower levels of SAI than those without cognitive impairment. To conclude, a set of challenges to be addressed before SAI can be validated as a useful clinical tool in PD are presented.

TI  - Interactions of visual hallucinations, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: A review
T2  - PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS
AB  - Patients with Parkinson's disease may develop various non-motor symptoms during the course of the illness. Visual hallucinations (VH) and cognitive impairment (CI) are two common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Studies have reported association of both VH and CI with presence of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Presence of visual hallucinations and cognitive impairment has been described as risk factors for emergence of each other. There is marked overlap in the risk factors for development of RBD, VH and CI in patients with PD. Results of clinical and epidemiological studies as well as studies based on neuroimaging, electrophysiology especially transcranial magnetic stimulation and neuropsycholgical evaluations in PD patients have suggested presence of certain common neurobiological process leading to emergence of RBD, VH and CI. Structural neuroimaging studies using voxel-based morphometry have often reported grey matter atrophy of hippocampus and parahippocampal cortices in PD patients with RBD, VH and CI. Cholinergic dysfunction is common in PD patients with RBD, VH and CI. This review explores the complex interactions of RBD, VH and CI in patients with PD and their potential implications.

TI  - Fatigue in Parkinson's disease and potential interventions
T2  - NEUROREHABILITATION
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It occurs at every stage of PD and affects quality of life. Fatigue severity worsens over time as PD progresses, and it is associated with other non-motor symptoms such as apathy, depression, sleep disorder, and cognitive dysfunction.
   PURPOSE: In this literature review, I discuss the measurement and pathophysiology of fatigue and fatigability. There are no evidence-based treatments for fatigue and fatigability available. I review several pilot studies on the effects of pharmacological agents and exercise on fatigue and fatigability. These studies provide some insights on the design of future larger clinical trials.
   CONCLUSION: Fatigue inventories including The Fatigue Severity Scale, the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, or the Parkinson Fatigue Scale are used to assess the severity of fatigue. Finger tapping and force generation are useful in quantifying physical fatigability. A reaction time paradigm such as the Attention Network Test can be used to measure cognitive fatigability. Physical fatigability is associated with the change in cortical excitability in PD measured by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Cognitive fatigability is most likely associated with the neurotransmitter abnormalities (dopaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic) in PD. Levodopa, modafanil, methylphenidate, and rasagiline may be effective in treating fatigue and fatigability. Exercise programs may also be effective.

TI  - Neurostimulation for traumatic brain injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a significant public health problem and is a leading cause of death and disability in many countries. Durable treatments for neurological function deficits following TBI have been elusive, as there are currently no FDA-approved therapeutic modalities for mitigating the consequences of TBI. Neurostimulation strategies using various forms of electrical stimulation have recently been applied to treat functional deficits in animal models and clinical stroke trials. The results from these studies suggest that neurostimulation may augment improvements in both motor and cognitive deficits after brain injury. Several studies have taken this approach in animal models of TBI, showing both behavioral enhancement and biological evidence of recovery. There have been only a few studies using deep brain stimulation (DBS) in human TBI patients, and future studies are warranted to validate the feasibility of this technique in the clinical treatment of TBI. In this review, the authors summarize insights from studies employing neurostimulation techniques in the setting of brain injury. Moreover, they relate these findings to the future prospect of using DBS to ameliorate motor and cognitive deficits following TBI.

TI  - Non-pharmacological interventions and neuroplasticity in early stage Alzheimer's disease
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Non-pharmacological interventions have the potential to reduce cognitive decline and to improve psychosocial aspects in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia, and the absence of side effects makes them a favorable option also for preventive strategies. We provide an overview on recent studies involving cognitive training and reminiscence, stimulating and challenging experiences such as visual art and music, physical activities, and electromagnetic stimulation. We review findings on neuroplasticity in the aging brain and their relevance for cognitive improvement in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss cognitive reserve and possible mechanisms that drive neuroplasticity and new learning. Finally, we identify promising avenues for future intervention strategies and research, such as combinations of cognitive and pharmaceutical interventions, and individual strategies adapted to the disease stage and tailored to the needs, predispositions and preferences of patients.

TI  - Brain function decline in healthy retired athletes who sustained their last sports concussion in early adulthood
T2  - BRAIN
AB  - Recent studies have shown that the detrimental effects of sports concussions on cognitive and motor function may persist up to a few years post-injury. The present study sought to investigate the effects of having sustained a sports concussion more than 30 years prior to testing on cognitive and motor functions. Nineteen healthy former athletes, in late adulthood (mean age 60.79; SD 5.16), who sustained their last sport-related concussion in early adulthood (mean age 26.05; SD 9.21) were compared with 21 healthy former athletes with no history of concussion (mean age 58.89; SD 9.07). Neuropsychological tests sensitive to age-related changes in cognition were administered. An auditory oddball paradigm was used to evoke P3a and P3b brain responses. Four TMS paradigms were employed to assess motor cortex excitability: (i) resting motor threshold; (ii) paired-pulse intracortical inhibition and intracortical facilitation; (iii) input/output curve and (iv) cortical silent period (CSP). A rapid alternating movement task was also used to characterize motor system dysfunctions. Relative to controls, former athletes with a history of concussion had: (i) lower performance on neuropsychological tests of episodic memory and response inhibition; (ii) significantly delayed and attenuated P3a/P3b components; (iii) significantly prolonged CSP and (iv) significantly reduced movement velocity (bradykinesia). The finding that the P3, the CSP as well as neuropsychological and motor indices were altered more than three decades post-concussion provides evidence for the chronicity of cognitive and motor system changes consecutive to sports concussion.

TI  - Mutual Interactions between Brain States and Alzheimer's Disease Pathology: A Focus on Gamma and Slow Oscillations
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary Electrical activity in the brain dynamically changes throughout the day. Abnormalities in brain activity have been associated with various brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). While brain disorders stem from complex pathological processes, resulting in abnormalities in neural activity and cognitive deficits, recent studies have demonstrated that controlling brain activity can modify disease pathologies as well as cognitive functions. In particular, studies in mouse models of AD have provided promising results regarding the amelioration of AD pathology by invasive and non-invasive brain stimulations. In this review article, by focusing on AD, we provide an overview of this emerging field. We summarise how brain activity changes in humans and mouse models, and how different artificial manipulations of brain activity can modify AD pathology. Although further investigations are essential, this research direction will provide insight into non-pharmacological intervention strategies for dementia. Brain state varies from moment to moment. While brain state can be defined by ongoing neuronal population activity, such as neuronal oscillations, this is tightly coupled with certain behavioural or vigilant states. In recent decades, abnormalities in brain state have been recognised as biomarkers of various brain diseases and disorders. Intriguingly, accumulating evidence also demonstrates mutual interactions between brain states and disease pathologies: while abnormalities in brain state arise during disease progression, manipulations of brain state can modify disease pathology, suggesting a therapeutic potential. In this review, by focusing on Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, we provide an overview of how brain states change in AD patients and mouse models, and how controlling brain states can modify AD pathology. Specifically, we summarise the relationship between AD and changes in gamma and slow oscillations. As pathological changes in these oscillations correlate with AD pathology, manipulations of either gamma or slow oscillations can modify AD pathology in mouse models. We argue that neuromodulation approaches to target brain states are a promising non-pharmacological intervention for neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - TREATMENT OF COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: A PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGICAL REVIEW
T2  - PSYCHIATRIA DANUBINA
AB  - The growing and aging population has contributed to the increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other types of dementia in the world. AD is a progressive and degenerative brain disease with an onset characterized by episodic memory impairments, although progressive deficits can be observed in several domains including language, executive functions, attention and working memory. The relationship between cognitive impairments and the topography and progression of brain neuropathology is well established. The pathophysiologic mechanisms and processes that underline the course of cognitive and clinical decline have been the theoretical support for the development of pharmacological treatments for AD. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists are the main drugs used in the management of global cognitive impairment and several studies also explore the effects of both in specific cognitive measures. Recent research trends also examine the effects of combination therapy using both compounds. This review aims to update practical recommendations for the treatment of global cognitive functioning and specific neurocognitive deficits in AD using ChEIs, NMDA antagonists and combination therapy with both drugs.

TI  - Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation: A New Strategy in Mild Cognitive Impairment?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques can significantly modulate cognitive functions in healthy subjects and patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, they have been applied in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) to prevent or delay the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we review this emerging empirical corpus and discuss therapeutic effects of NIBS on several target functions (e.g., memory for face-name associations and non-verbal recognition, attention, psychomotor speed, everyday memory). Available studies have yielded mixed results, possibly due to differences among their tasks, designs, and samples, let alone the latter's small sizes. Thus, the impact of NIBS on cognitive performance in MCI and SCI remains to be determined. To foster progress in this direction, we outline methodological approaches that could improve the efficacy and specificity of NIBS in both conditions. Furthermore, we discuss the need for multicenter studies, accurate diagnosis, and longitudinal approaches combining NIBS with specific training regimes. These tenets could cement biomedical developments supporting new treatments for MCI and preventive therapies for AD.

TI  - The effect of L-dopa in Parkinson's disease as revealed by neurophysiological studies of motor and sensory functions
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Introduction: This review will first discuss evidence of motor and sensory abnormalities as yielded by neurophysiological techniques in patients with PD. It will then go on to describe the effects of L-dopa replacement on motor and sensory abnormalities in PD as assessed by neurophysiological studies.Areas covered: We analyzed papers in English using Pubmed with the following keywords: L-dopa, dopamine, bradykinesia, basal ganglia, kinematic analysis, TMS, motor cortex plasticity, motor cortex excitability, somatosensory discrimination threshold, painExpert commentary: L-dopa improves the amplitude and speed of upper limb voluntary movements, but it does not restore abnormalities in the sequence effect or voluntary facial movements. L-dopa only partially normalizes changes in motor cortex excitability and plasticity and has also contrasting effects on the sensory system and on sensory-motor integration. The neurophysiological studies reviewed here show that PD is more than a hypo-dopaminergic disease, and non-dopaminergic mechanisms should also be considered.

TI  - Management of psychiatric and cognitive complications in Parkinson's disease
T2  - BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) such as affective disorders, psychosis, behavioral changes, and cognitive impairment are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, NPSs remain under-recognized and under-treated, often leading to adverse outcomes. Their epidemiology, presentation, risk factors, neural substrate, and management strategies are incompletely understood. While psychological and psychosocial factors may contribute, hallmark PD neuropathophysiological changes, plus the associations between exposure to dopaminergic medications and occurrence of some symptoms, suggest a neurobiological basis for many NPSs. A range of psychotropic medications, psychotherapeutic techniques, stimulation therapies, and other non-pharmacological treatments have been studied, are used clinically, and are beneficial for managing NPSs in PD. Appropriate management of NPSs is critical for comprehensive PD care, from recognizing their presentations and timing throughout the disease course, to the incorporation of different therapeutic strategies (ie, pharmacological and non-pharmacological) that utilize a multidisciplinary approach.

TI  - Tau, Amyloid Beta and Deep Brain Stimulation: Aiming to Restore Cognitive Deficit in Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The last two decades have seen a great advance in the data that supports the two current hypotheses in Alzheimer's disease field, the amyloid beta hypothesis and the tau hypothesis. Not surprisingly, A beta and tau proteins are currently the major therapeutic research targets for AD treatment. Unfortunately, nothing but moderate success has emerged from such therapeutic approaches. With this in mind, we will discuss deep brain stimulation as a promising therapeutic strategy that aims to restore brain activity. Lastly, in the scope of cognitive deficit restoration, we will discuss the relevance of the limbic formation as a promising neuroanatomical target for deep brain stimulation.
   Methods: Immunohistochemistry for modified tau (phosphorylated at Ser199-202-Thr205 labelled by the antibody AT8) was performed on paraffin-embedded human brain sections providing a detailed characterization of NFT pathology.
   Results: Abnormally phosphorylated tau protein is the key common marker in several brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Pick Disease, Down syndrome and frontotemporal dementia and is capable of affecting synaptic events that are critical for memory formation. With this in mind, therapeutic strategies aiming to restore synaptic events could offer better outcomes.
   Conclusion: The humble success of current therapeutic strategies along with the lack of basic knowledge of the brain disease mechanisms calls for alternatives that benefit patients in the present moment. One of particular interest is the neurostimulation strategy that is already a well-established treatment for several movement disorders and when compared to current Alzheimer's therapeutic strategies, deep brain stimulation does not directly interfere with the normal protein function, therefore increasing the probability of success.

TI  - Spotting psychopaths using technology
T2  - REVIEWS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES
AB  - For the past three and a half decades, the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) and the self-report Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (PPI-R) have been the standard measures for the diagnosis of psychopathy. Technological approaches can enhance these diagnostic methodologies. The purpose of this paper is to present a state-of-the-art review of various technological approaches for spotting psychopathy, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and other measures. Results of EEG event-related potential (ERP) experiments support the theory that impaired amygdala function may be responsible for abnormal fear processing in psychopathy, which can ultimately manifest as psychopathic traits, as outlined by the PCL-R or PPI-R. Imaging studies, in general, point to reduced fear processing capabilities in psychopathic individuals. While the human element, introduced through researcher/participant interactions, can be argued as unequivocally necessary for diagnosis, these purely objective technological approaches have proven to be useful in conjunction with the subjective interviewing and questionnaire methods for differentiating psychopaths from non-psychopaths. Furthermore, these technologies are more robust than behavioral measures, which have been shown to fail.

TI  - Advances in the Treatment of Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease
T2  - MOVEMENT DISORDERS
AB  - Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a frequent complication, with significant interindividual variability in clinical symptoms, severity, timing, and neural substrates. Recent studies have focused not only on understanding PD dementia, but also mild cognitive impairment in PD, which may represent a prodromal stage for dementia. In recent years, there have been important advances regarding clinical characterizations, definitions, associated biomarkers, and risk factors for both mild cognitive impairment in PD and PD dementia. However, there is a paucity of effective therapies for cognitive impairment in PD, whether for mild symptoms or for moderate to severe dementia. At present, only rivastigmine is U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for PD dementia, an indication received nearly a decade ago. Given the frequency of PD cognitive impairment and its substantial impact on both patients and families, the lack of available and effective treatments represents a striking gap in the field, especially when compared to the large number of available therapies for PD motor symptoms and complications. Improved symptomatic therapies, as well as potential disease-modifying agents, for PD cognitive impairment are needed. Most therapeutic trials for PD dementia and mild cognitive impairment in PD have focused on drugs developed for and tested in Alzheimer's disease, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, memantine, though recent and ongoing trials examine the effects of pharmacological agents affecting other neurotransmitters, as well as nonpharmacological therapies, including mental and physical exercise and neurostimulation. This review summarizes the design and outcomes of trials for PD cognitive impairment published since 2013 and highlights future therapeutic research opportunities and challenges.

TI  - Can Cognitive Models Explain Brain Activation During Word and Pseudoword Reading? A Meta-Analysis of 36 Neuroimaging Studies
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN
AB  - Reading in many alphabetic writing systems depends on both item-specific knowledge used to read irregular words (sew, yacht) and generative spelling sound knowledge used to read pseudowords (tew, yash). Research into the neural basis of these abilities has been directed largely by cognitive accounts proposed by the dual-route cascaded and triangle models of reading. We develop a framework that enables predictions for neural activity to be derived from cognitive models of reading using 2 principles: (a) the extent to which a model component or brain region is engaged by a stimulus and (b) how much effort is exerted in processing that stimulus. To evaluate the derived predictions, we conducted a meta-analysis of 36 neuroimaging studies of reading using the quantitative activation likelihood estimation technique. Reliable clusters of activity are localized during word versus pseudoword and irregular versus regular word reading and demonstrate a great deal of convergence between the functional organization of the reading system put forward by cognitive models and the neural systems activated during reading tasks. Specifically, left-hemisphere activation clusters are revealed reflecting orthographic analysis (occipitotemporal cortex), lexical and/or semantic processing (anterior fusiform, middle temporal gyrus), spelling-sound conversion (inferior parietal cortex), and phonological output resolution (inferior frontal gyrus). Our framework and results establish that cognitive models of reading are relevant for interpreting neuroimaging studies and that neuroscientific studies can provide data relevant for advancing cognitive models. This article thus provides a firm empirical foundation from which to improve integration between cognitive and neural accounts of the reading process.

TI  - The Rehabilitation Potential of Neurostimulation for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in Animal and Human Studies
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - Neurostimulation carries high therapeutic potential, accompanied by an excellent safety profile. In this review, we argue that an arena in which these tools could provide breakthrough benefits is traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is a major health problem worldwide, with the majority of cases identified as mild TBI (mTBI). MTBI is of concern because it is a modifiable risk factor for dementia. A major challenge in studying mTBI is its inherent heterogeneity across a large feature space (e.g., etiology, age of injury, sex, treatment, initial health status, etc.). Parallel lines of research in human and rodent mTBI can be collated to take advantage of the full suite of neuroscience tools, from neuroimaging (electroencephalography: EEG; functional magnetic resonance imaging: fMRI; diffusion tensor imaging: DTI) to biochemical assays. Despite these attractive components and the need for effective treatments, there are at least two major challenges to implementation. First, there is insufficient understanding of how neurostimulation alters neural mechanisms. Second, there is insufficient understanding of how mTBI alters neural function. The goal of this review is to assemble interrelated but disparate areas of research to identify important gaps in knowledge impeding the implementation of neurostimulation.

TI  - Pathophysiological and diagnostic implications of cortical dysfunction in ALS
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS NEUROLOGY
AB  - Cortical dysfunction-specifically, the development of hyperexcitability-seems to be an early and intrinsic feature of sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) phenotypes, preceding the onset of lower motor neuron dysfunction and correlating with ensuing lower motor neuron dysfunction and degeneration. In fact, cortical dysfunction could provide a pathogenic basis for ALS, with corticomotor neuronal hyperexcitability mediating motor neuron degeneration via a trans-synaptic, glutamate-mediated, excitotoxic mechanism. The recent identification of C9orf72 repeat expansion as an important genetic risk factor for both ALS and frontotemporal dementia has underscored the importance of cortical function in ALS pathogenesis, and has helped to confirm that the disease forms part of a spectrum of central neurodegenerative processes. Changes in cortical function that develop in ALS could prove useful as diagnostic biomarkers, potentially enhancing the diagnosis of ALS at an early stage of the disease process. Pathophysiological and diagnostic biomarkers of cortical function might also provide insights to guide the development of future therapeutic approaches, including stem cell and genetic interventions, thereby providing potential for more-effective management of patients with ALS.

TI  - VaD - An Integrated Framework for Cognitive Rehabilitation
T2  - CNS & NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS-DRUG TARGETS
AB  - Background & Objective: Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia, with clinical features that depend on neural substrates affected by the vascular lesions. Like most neurological disorders, it involves alterations that range from the molecular level to neuronal networks. Such alterations begin as compensatory mechanisms that reshape every subsystem involved in the brain's homeostasis. Although there have been recent huge advances in understanding the pathophysiology of cognitive dysfunction, a suitable therapeutic approach to vascular dementia remains elusive. Pharmacological interventions have failed to sustainably improve cognitive function, and it is a well-known fact that there is a need to change the current view for providing neuroprotection and enhancing neurorecovery after stroke. Studies regarding cognitive training are also faced with the difficulty of drawing up protocols that can embrace a holistic approach in cognitively impaired patients.
   Conclusion: This review will present a brief synthesis of current results from basic research data and clinical studies regarding pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in vascular dementia and will offer an integrated view from the perspective of systems biology.

TI  - New Perspective for Non-invasive Brain Stimulation Site Selection in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Based on Meta- and Functional Connectivity Analyses
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background: Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been widely used to treat mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, there exists no consensus on the best stimulation sites.
   Objective: To explore potential stimulation locations for NIBS treatment in patients with MCI, combining meta- and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses.
   Methods: The meta-analysis was conducted to identify brain regions associated with MCI. Regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted based on this meta-analysis. The rsFC analysis was applied to 45 MCI patients to determine brain surface regions that are functionally connected with the above ROIs.
   Results: We found that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were the overlapping brain regions between our results and those of previous studies. In addition, we recommend that the temporoparietal junction (including the angular gyrus), which was found in both the meta-and rsFC analysis, should be considered in NIBS treatment of MCI. Furthermore, the bilateral orbital prefrontal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, medial superior frontal gyrus, and right inferior occipital gyrus may be potential brain stimulation sites for NIBS treatment of MCI.
   Conclusion: Our results provide several potential sites for NIBS, such as the DLFPC and IFG, and may shed light on the locations of NIBS sites in the treatment of patients with MCI.

TI  - Modeling neurodegenerative disorders in zebrafish
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Neurodegeneration is a major cause of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, multiple and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pontocerebellar hypoplasia, dementia and other related brain disorders. Their complex pathogenesis commonly includes genetic and neurochemical deficits, misfolded protein toxicity, demyelination, apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunctions. Albeit differing in specific underlying mechanisms, neurodegenerative disorders typically display evolutionarily conserved mechanisms across taxa. Here, we review the role of zebrafish models in recapitulating major human and rodent neurodegenerative conditions, demonstrating this species as a highly relevant experimental model for research on neurodegenerative diseases, and discussing how these fish models can further clarify the underlying genetic, neurochemical, neuroanatomical and behavioral pathogenic mechanisms.

TI  - Changes in Plasticity Across the Lifespan: Cause of Disease and Target for Intervention
T2  - CHANGING BRAINS APPLYING BRAIN PLASTICITY TO ADVANCE AND RECOVER HUMAN ABILITY
AB  - We conceptualize brain plasticity as an intrinsic property of the nervous system enabling rapid adaptation in response to changes in an organism's internal and external environment. In prenatal and early postnatal development, plasticity allows for the formation of organized nervous system circuitry and the establishment of functional networks. As the individual is exposed to various sensory stimuli in the environment, brain plasticity allows for functional and structural adaptation and underlies learning and memory. We argue that the mechanisms of plasticity change over the lifespan with different slopes of change in different individuals. These changes play a key role in the clinical phenotype of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism and schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Altered plasticity not only can trigger maladaptive cascades and can be the cause of deficits and disability but also offers opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions. In this chapter, we discuss the importance of brain plasticity across the lifespan and how neuroplasticity-based therapies offer promise for disorders with otherwise limited effective treatment.

TI  - Review Article Stroke and molecular imaging: a focus on FDG-PET
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
AB  - Stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide, the second most common cause of dementia and the third leading cause of death. Though the etiology of stroke has been explored extensively, there remains open questions in the scientific and clinical study of stroke. Traditional imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, have been applied extensively and remain mainstays in clinical practice. Nevertheless, positron emission tomography has proven to be a powerful molecular imaging tool in exploring the scientific aspects of neurological disease, and stroke remains an area of great interest. This review article examines the role of positron emission tomography in the study of stroke including its contributions to elaborating related pathophysiology and delving into possible clinical applications.

TI  - Effects of electromagnetic fields emitted by GSM phones on working memory: a meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background and ObjectiveCurrent treatments for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) do not affect the course of the illness and brain stimulation techniques are increasingly promoted as potential therapeutic interventions for AD. This study reviews the effects of electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure versus sham exposure on working memory (WM) performance of healthy human participants.
   MethodOnline literature databases and previous systematic reviews were searched for studies of EMF and WM in participants without reported memory problems. Two thousand eight hundred and fifty seven studies were identified, and 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. An assessment of study quality was completed, and separate, random effects meta-analyses were conducted for each of the three WM tasks included: n-back, substitution and digit span forward.
   ResultsNo differences were found between participants exposed to active EMF versus sham conditions in any of the three working memory tasks examined.
   ConclusionResults indicate that EMF does not affect WM during the n-back, substitution and digit-span tasks. Future studies should focus on the possible effects of chronic exposure to EMF in older adults with AD using a battery of comparable WM and attention tasks, before EMF can be seriously considered as a potential modulator of WM in AD.

TI  - Neurophysiological markers of network dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases
T2  - NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL
AB  - There is strong clinical, imaging and pathological evidence that neurodegeneration is associated with altered brain connectivity. While functional imaging (fMRI) can detect resting and activated states of metabolic activity, its use is limited by poor temporal resolution, cost and confounding vascular parameters. By contrast, electrophysiological (e.g. EEG/MEG) recordings provide direct measures of neural activity with excellent temporal resolution, and source localization methodologies can address problems of spatial resolution, permitting measurement of functional activity of brain networks with a spatial resolution similar to that of fMRI. This opens an exciting therapeutic approach focussed on pharmacological and physiological modulation of brain network activity.
   This review describes current neurophysiological approaches towards evaluating cortical network dysfunction in common neurodegenerative disorders. It explores how modern neurophysiologic tools can provide markers for diagnosis, prognosis, subcategorization and clinical trial outcome measures, and how modulation of brain networks can contribute to new therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Neuroprotection and Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation: Facts or Fiction?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and repetitive Magnetic Transcranial Stimulation (rTMS), are well-known non-pharmacological approaches to improve both motor and non-motor symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Their use is of particular interest especially for the treatment of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as axial disturbances in Parkinson's (PD), where conventional pharmacological therapies show very mild and short-lasting effects. However, their ability to interfere with disease progression over time is not well understood; recent evidence suggests that NIBS may have a neuroprotective effect, thus slowing disease progression and modulating the aggregation state of pathological proteins. In this narrative review, we gather current knowledge about neuroprotection and NIBS in neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., PD and AD), just mentioning the few results related to stroke. As further matter of debate, we discuss similarities and differences with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)-induced neuroprotective effects, and highlight possible future directions for ongoing clinical studies.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms and the adequacy of brain stimulation: state of the art
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Introduction: Heterogeneity of therapeutic response to brain stimulation techniques has inspired scientists to uncover the secrets to success or failure of these projects. Genetic polymorphisms are one of the major causes of this heterogeneity.Areas covered: More than twenty genetic variants within more than ten genes (e.g. BDNF, COMT, DRD2, TRPV1, 5-HT1A, 5-HHT, P2RX7, VEGF, TPH1, TPH2, ACE, APOE, GNB3, NET, NMDA receptors, and RGS4) have been investigated, among which the BDNF gene and its polymorphism, Val66Met, is the best documented variant. We review the genotypic combinations, which are reported to interact with the work of brain stimulation, of which the DRD2 C957T polymorphism is the most prominent type. Finally, implications of transcranial magnetic stimulation in deciphering the interaction between genetic background (e.g. SCN1A and 5-HTT) and drugs (e.g. carbamazepine and citalopram) at the cortical excitability level is explained.Expert commentary: Studies are ongoing to find missing factors responsible for heterogeneity of response to brain stimulation techniques. Further knowledge about genetic factors affecting the therapeutic response to brain stimulation techniques might provide helpful guidelines for choosing ideal candidates for treatment.

TI  - Progress, development, and challenges in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clinical trials
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - IntroductionAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) brings unique challenges to a clinical trial setting, due in part to relatively low disease prevalence coupled with a poor prognosis, in addition to the complexities linked to disease heterogeneity. As critical understanding of the disease develops, particularly in relation to clinical phenotype and the mechanisms of disease progression, so too new concepts evolve in relation to clinical trials, including the advent of precision therapy, targeted to subgroups of ALS patients.Areas coveredIndividualized, or precision medicine in ALS recognizes the heterogeneous nature of the disease and utilizes information such as the clinical phenotype of the disease, clinical biomarkers, and genotyping to promote a tailored approach to treatment. Separate to these considerations, the present review will discuss clinical trial design and how this can be improved to better match patient and investigator needs in ALS clinical trials.Expert opinionPrecision therapy will promote a more focused treatment approach, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes for ALS patients. An increased community awareness of ALS, coupled with significant industry and philanthropic funding for ALS research, is accelerating this process.

TI  - Transcranial direct current stimulation: neurophysiology and clinical applications
T2  - NEUROPSYCHIATRY
AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is considered a noninvasive and well-tolerated brain stimulation technique with very few adverse side effects. Importantly, tDCS does not directly evoke neuronal firing (as induced by electroconvulsive or transcranial magnetic stimulation), but instead alters the resting membrane potential of pre- and post-synaptic neurons dependent on the current polarity in the stimulated brain region. Animal studies suggest changes in long-term potentiation occur via glutamate release in response to anodal tDCS, thereby affecting learning and memory. In clinical studies, a current not exceeding 2 mA/cm(2) is applied for 20-30 min via sponge electrodes placed above the target brain region. To date, a number of clinical studies have reported some promising effects when treating patients with depression, chronic pain, schizophrenia, dementia, Parkinson's disease and cerebral stroke. However, appropriately designed randomized controlled clinical trials are scarce and reported intervention effect sizes only vary from small to moderate, with little evidence for sustained long-term effects.

TI  - Brain excitability and connectivity of neuronal assemblies in Alzheimer's disease: From animal models to human findings
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - The human brain contains about 100 billion neurons forming an intricate network of innumerable connections, which continuously adapt and rewire themselves following inputs from external and internal environments as well as the physiological synaptic, dendritic and axonal sculpture during brain maturation and throughout the life span.
   Growing evidence supports the idea that Alzheimer's disease (AD) targets selected and functionally connected neuronal networks and, specifically, their synaptic terminals, affecting brain connectivity well before producing neuronal loss and compartmental atrophy.
   The understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the dismantling of neuronal circuits and the implementation of 'clinically oriented' methods to map-out the dynamic interactions amongst neuronal assemblies will enhance early/pre-symptomatic diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. More important, this will open the avenues to innovative treatments, bridging the gap between molecular mechanisms and the variety of symptoms forming disease phenotype.
   In the present review a set of evidence supports the idea that altered brain connectivity, exhausted neural plasticity and aberrant neuronal activity are facets of the same coin linked to age-related neurodegenerative dementia of Alzheimer type.
   Investigating their respective roles in AD pathophysiology will help in translating findings from basic research to clinical applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - ENHANCING ATTENTION IN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES: CURRENT THERAPIES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - We all experience at least occasional lapses in attention but in some neurological conditions, loss of attention is pervasive and debilitating. Treating deficits in attention first requires an understanding of the neurobiology of attention, which we now understand to be a set of different cognitive processes. Cholinesterase inhibitors are already established as effective attentional enhancers used in the treatment of certain dementias. Other stimulant agents such as modafanil, amphetamine and methylphenidate have demonstrated limited success in healthy individuals where attention is already optimal and clinical trials in patients with neurological disease are sparse. Dietary and lifestyle changes are gaining increasing prominence, as are experimental treatments such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. As the therapeutic arsenal widens, clinicians will be able to match specific treatments to selective deficits in attention, giving patients a tailored management plan. Here we review common diseases that impair attention and emphasise how an understanding of attentional processing within the brain might lead to improved therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Language abnormalities in schizophrenia: binding core symptoms through contemporary empirical evidence
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA
AB  - Both the ability to speak and to infer complex linguistic messages from sounds have been claimed as uniquely human phenomena. In schizophrenia, formal thought disorder (FTD) and auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are manifestations respectively relating to concrete disruptions of those abilities. From an evolutionary perspective, Crow (1997) proposed that "schizophrenia is the price that Homo sapiens pays for the faculty of language". Epidemiological and experimental evidence points to an overlap between FTD and AVHs, yet a thorough investigation examining their shared neural mechanism in schizophrenia is lacking. In this review, we synthesize observations from three key domains. First, neuroanatomical evidence indicates substantial shared abnormalities in language-processing regions between FTD and AVHs, even in the early phases of schizophrenia. Second, neurochemical studies point to a glutamate-related dysfunction in these language-processing brain regions, contributing to verbal production deficits. Third, genetic findings further show how genes that overlap between schizophrenia and language disorders influence neurodevelopment and neurotransmission. We argue that these observations converge into the possibility that a glutamatergic dysfunction in language-processing brain regions might be a shared neural basis of both FTD and AVHs. Investigations of language pathology in schizophrenia could facilitate the development of diagnostic tools and treatments, so we call for multilevel confirmatory analyses focused on modulations of the language network as a therapeutic goal in schizophrenia.

TI  - Combotherapy and current concepts as well as future strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
T2  - NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT
AB  - It has been estimated that 35.6 million people globally had dementia in 2010 and the prevalence of dementia has been predicted to double every 20 years. Thus, 115.4 million people may be living with dementia in 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is present in 60%-70% of people with dementia. Unfortunately, there are few approved drugs that can alleviate the cognitive or behavioral symptoms of AD dementia. Recent studies have revealed that pathophysiological changes related to AD occur decades before the appearance of clinical symptoms of dementia. This extended preclinical phase of AD provides a critical chance for disease-modifying agents to halt or delay the relentless process of AD. Although several trials targeting various pathological processes are ongoing, the examination of the combined use of different approaches to combat AD seems warranted. In this article, we will review current therapies, future strategies, and ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of AD with a special focus on combination therapies. Furthermore, preventive strategies for cognitively normal subjects in the presymptomatic stages of AD will also be addressed. In this review, we discuss current hypotheses of the disease process. In the decades since the approval of cholinesterase inhibitors, no new drug has ultimately demonstrated clear success in clinical trials. Given the difficulties that have been encountered in attempts to identify a single drug that can treat AD, we must pursue effective multi-target strategies, ie, combination therapies. The combination of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine is considered well tolerated and safe, and this combination benefits patients with moderate-to-severe AD. In contrast, with the exception of adjuvant therapies of conventional drugs, combinations of different disease-modifying agents with different mechanisms may have promising synergic effects and benefit cognition, behavior, and daily living function.

TI  - Protocols for cognitive enhancement. A user manual for Brain Health Services-part 5 of 6
T2  - ALZHEIMERS RESEARCH & THERAPY
AB  - Cognitive complaints in the absence of objective cognitive impairment, observed in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), are common in old age. The first step to postpone cognitive decline is to use techniques known to improve cognition, i.e., cognitive enhancement techniques. We aimed to provide clinical recommendations to improve cognitive performance in cognitively unimpaired individuals, by using cognitive, mental, or physical training (CMPT), non-invasive brain stimulations (NIBS), drugs, or nutrients. We made a systematic review of CMPT studies based on the GRADE method rating the strength of evidence. CMPT have clinically relevant effects on cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. The quality of evidence supporting the improvement of outcomes following a CMPT was high for metamemory; moderate for executive functions, attention, global cognition, and generalization in daily life; and low for objective memory, subjective memory, motivation, mood, and quality of life, as well as a transfer to other cognitive functions. Regarding specific interventions, CMPT based on repeated practice (e.g., video games or mindfulness, but not physical training) improved attention and executive functions significantly, while CMPT based on strategic learning significantly improved objective memory. We found encouraging evidence supporting the potential effect of NIBS in improving memory performance, and reducing the perception of self-perceived memory decline in SCD. Yet, the high heterogeneity of stimulation protocols in the different studies prevent the issuing of clear-cut recommendations for implementation in a clinical setting. No conclusive argument was found to recommend any of the main pharmacological cognitive enhancement drugs ("smart drugs", acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, antidepressant) or herbal extracts (Panax ginseng, Gingko biloba, and Bacopa monnieri) in people without cognitive impairment. Altogether, this systematic review provides evidence for CMPT to improve cognition, encouraging results for NIBS although more studies are needed, while it does not support the use of drugs or nutrients.

TI  - Incomplete evidence that increasing current intensity of tDCS boosts outcomes
T2  - BRAIN STIMULATION
AB  - Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is investigated to modulate neuronal function by applying a fixed low-intensity direct current to scalp.
   Objectives: We critically discuss evidence for a monotonic response in effect size with increasing current intensity, with a specific focus on a question if increasing applied current enhance the efficacy of tDCS.
   Methods: We analyzed tDCS intensity does-response from different perspectives including biophysical modeling, animal modeling, human neurophysiology, neuroimaging and behavioral/clinical measures. Further, we discuss approaches to design dose-response trials.
   Results: Physical models predict electric field in the brain increases with applied tDCS intensity. Data from animal studies are lacking since a range of relevant low-intensities is rarely tested. Results from imaging studies are ambiguous while human neurophysiology, including using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as a probe, suggests a complex state-dependent non-monotonic dose response. The diffusivity of brain current flow produced by conventional tDCS montages complicates this analysis, with relatively few studies on focal High Definition (HD)-tDCS. In behavioral and clinical trials, only a limited range of intensities (1-2 mA), and typically just one intensity, are conventionally tested; moreover, outcomes are subject brain-state dependent. Measurements and models of current flow show that for the same applied current, substantial differences in brain current occur across individuals. Trials are thus subject to inter-individual differences that complicate consideration of population-level dose response.
   Conclusion: The presence or absence of simple dose response does not impact how efficacious a given tDCS dose is for a given indication. Understanding dose-response in human applications of tDCS is needed for protocol optimization including individualized dose to reduce outcome variability, which requires intelligent design of dose-response studies.

TI  - The role of higher-level cognitive function in gait: Executive dysfunction contributes to fall risk in Alzheimer's disease
T2  - DEMENTIA AND GERIATRIC COGNITIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Alzheimer's disease ( AD) is generally understood as primarily affecting cognition while sparing motor function, at least until the later stages of the disease. Studies reported over the past 10 years, however, have documented a prevalence of falls in AD patients significantly higher than in age-matched normal elders; also persons with AD have been observed to have different walking patterns with characteristics that increase gait instability. Recent work in cognitive neuroscience has begun to demonstrate the necessity of intact cognition, particularly executive function, for competent motor control. We put the pieces of this puzzle together and review the current state of knowledge about gait and cognition in general along with an exploration of the association between dementia, gait impairment and falls in AD. We also briefly examine the current treatment of gait instability in AD, mainly exercise, and propose a new approach targeting cognition. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

TI  - Therapeutic approaches for improving cognitive function in the aging brain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - The rapid aging of populations around the world has become an unprecedented challenge. Aging is associated with cognitive impairment, including dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Successful drug development for improving or maintaining cognition in the elderly is critically important. Although 4 drugs for improving cognition in Alzheimer's disease have been approved, a variety of potential drugs targeting age-related cognitive impairment are still in development. In addition, non-pharmacological interventions, including cognition-oriented treatments, non-invasive brain stimulation physical exercise, and lifestyle-related interventions, have also been suggested as cognitive enhancers in the last decade. In this paper, we reviewed the recent evidence of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions aimed at improving or maintaining cognition in the elderly.

TI  - Neural oscillations and brain stimulation in Alzheimer's disease
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Aging is associated with alterations in cognitive processing and brain neurophysiology. Whereas the primary symptom of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is memory problems greater than normal for age and education, patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show impairments in other cognitive domains in addition to memory dysfunction. Resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) studies in physiological aging indicate a global increase in low-frequency oscillations' power and the reduction and slowing of alpha activity. The enhancement of slow and the reduction of fast oscillations, and the disruption of brain functional connectivity, however, are characterized as major rsEEG changes in AD. Recent rodent studies also support human evidence of age- and AD-related changes in resting-state brain oscillations, and the neuroprotective effect of brain stimulation techniques through gamma-band stimulations. Cumulatively, current evidence moves toward optimizing rsEEG features as reliable predictors of people with aMCI at risk for conversion to AD and mapping neural alterations subsequent to brain stimulation therapies. The present paper reviews the latest evidence of changes in rsEEG oscillations in physiological aging, aMCI, and AD, as well as findings of various brain stimulation therapies from both human and non-human studies.

TI  - Potentials and limits to enhance cognitive functions in healthy and pathological aging by tDCS
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that is increasingly used in research and clinical settings to enhance the effects of cognitive training. In our present review, we will first summarize studies using tDCS alone and in combination with cognitive training in older adults and patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). We will also review one study (Mainzer et al., 2014c) that showed an improvement in cognitive performance during anodal tDCS over the left inferior frontal cortex in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which is regarded as a prodromal stage of AD. Although promising short-term results have been reported, evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with sufficient sample sizes is scarce. In addition, stimulation protocols (in terms of intensity, duration, and repetition of stimulation) that lead to sustained improvements in outcome measures relevant for daily life still remain to be established. Following, we will discuss modulating factors such as technical parameters as well as the question whether there are specific cognitive functions (e.g., learning, memory consolidation, executive control) which are more amenable to tDCS enhancement than others. Finally, we will highlight future directions and limitations in this field and emphasize the need to conduct RCTs to establish efficacy of interventions for activities of daily life for a given patient population.

TI  - Minimally invasive motor cortex stimulation for Parkinson's disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Extra/intradural strip electrode implantation on motor cortex may be possible minimally invasive neurosurgical method for therapeutic neuromodulation in Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this review is to assess motor cortex stimulation (MCS) efficacy and safety in advanced PD. Sixteen published articles were included with a total of 130 PD patients treated. In almost all results are from prospective observational open labeled study, only in two studies blinded assessment was carried out. Negative results are reported in three studies. Significant improvement in motor symptoms with remarkable effect on axial symptoms, L-dopa-induced dyskinesia and quality of life are outlined in thirteen studies. Surgical technique involved implant of four-contact strip electrode over Ml in epidural space with exception of few cases in which implant was carried out in subdural space. Surgical procedure was performed contralateral to most affected side with exception of five patients in which it was carried at dominant hemisphere; in four patients electrode implant was bilateral but stimulation was carried out simultaneously on both sides only in two cases. Complications and adverse events occurred very rarely for extradural MCS whereas with higher rate for subdural MCS. Based on review of current literature extra/intradural MCS represents an alternative to deep brain stimulation (DBS) to surgically treat PD patients who are not candidate for DBS. MCS is a minimally invasive neuromodulation procedure with low morbidity-mortality that can relieve all three major symptoms of PD on both sides simultaneously and bilaterally; it has significant effectiveness on axial symptoms, gait disturbances and therapy complications.

TI  - Brain Stimulation for Improving Sleep and Memory
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE CLINICS
AB  - Given the critical role of sleep, particularly sleep slow oscillations, sleep spindles, and hippocampal sharp wave ripples, in memory consolidation, sleep enhancement represents a key opportunity to improve cognitive performance. Techniques such as transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation and acoustic stimulation can enhance slow oscillations and sleep spindles and potentially improve memory. Targeted memory reactivation in sleep may enhance or stabilize memory consolidation. Each technique has technical considerations that may limit its broader clinical application. Therefore, neurostimulation to enhance sleep quality, in particular sleep slow oscillations, has the potential for improving sleep-related memory consolidation in healthy and clinical populations.

TI  - Semantic memory and language dysfunction in early Alzheimer's disease: a review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background Language impairment in Alzheimer's disease occurs early, and language function deteriorates with progression of the illness to cause significant disability. This review focuses on language dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and the contribution of semantic memory impairment.
   Methods Electronic publication databases were searched for literature relevant to the review. Additionally, individual references were examined to elicit further studies not found by online search.
   Results Language impairment in Alzheimer's disease initially affects verbal fluency and naming before breakdown in other facets. Naming and fluency require integrity of semantic concepts, and dysfunction may be a marker of primary semantic memory impairment rather than overall cognitive decline. Research suggests the presence of semantic loss several years prior to diagnosis. Imaging studies indicate an altered connectivity state with respect to language networks, and this is associated with potential semantic failure. This state may also be present in individuals with established risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Compensatory recruitment of alternative cortical areas to supplement language function appears to occur and may be a target for future intervention.
   Conclusions Identifying and classifying the nature and degree of language impairment more closely could aid in developing targeted therapies. Treatments already established in other aphasic states, such as post-stroke, may be especially relevant. The nature of these and the protective nature of cognitive reserve are potential therapeutic avenues. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Update on the Neurobiology of Vascular Cognitive Impairment: From Lab to Clinic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - In the last years, there has been a significant growth in the literature exploring the pathophysiology of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). As an "umbrella term" encompassing any degree of vascular-related cognitive decline, VCI is deemed to be the most common cognitive disorder in the elderly, with a significant impact on social and healthcare expenses. Interestingly, some of the molecular, biochemical, and electrophysiological abnormalities detected in VCI seem to correlate with disease process and progression, eventually promoting an adaptive plasticity in some patients and a maladaptive, dysfunctional response in others. However, the exact relationships between vascular lesion, cognition, and neuroplasticity are not completely understood. Recent findings point out also the possibility to identify a panel of markers able to predict cognitive deterioration in the so-called "brain at risk" for vascular or mixed dementia. This will be of pivotal importance when designing trials of disease-modifying drugs or non-pharmacological approaches, including non-invasive neuromodulatory techniques. Taken together, these advances could make VCI a potentially preventable cause of both vascular and degenerative dementia in late life. This review provides a timely update on the recent serological, cerebrospinal fluid, histopathological, imaging, and neurophysiological studies on this "cutting-edge" topic, including the limitations, future perspectives and translational implications in the diagnosis and management of VCI patients.

Background The International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Evidence-Based Medicine Committee's recommendations for treatments of PD were first published in 2002, updated in 2011, and now updated again through December 31, 2016. Methods Level I studies testing pharmacological, surgical, or nonpharmacological interventions for the treatment of nonmotor symptoms in PD were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion and quality scoring were as previously reported. The disorders covered were a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, disorders of sleep and wakefulness, pain, fatigue, impaired olfaction, and ophthalmologic dysfunction. Clinical efficacy, implications for clinical practice, and safety conclusions are reported. Results A total of 37 new studies qualified for review. There were no randomized controlled trials that met inclusion criteria for the treatment of anxiety disorders, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, excessive sweating, impaired olfaction, or ophthalmologic dysfunction. We identified clinically useful or possibly useful interventions for the treatment of depression, apathy, impulse control and related disorders, dementia, psychosis, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, drooling, orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysfunction, urinary dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and pain. There were no clinically useful interventions identified to treat non-dementia-level cognitive impairment. Conclusions The evidence base for treating a range of nonmotor symptoms in PD has grown substantially in recent years. However, treatment options overall remain limited given the high prevalence and adverse impact of these disorders, so the development and testing of new treatments for nonmotor symptoms in PD remains a top priority.

TI  - Boosting psychological change: Combining non-invasive brain stimulation with psychotherapy
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Mental health disorders and substance use disorders are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and one of the most important challenges for public health systems. While evidence-based psychotherapy is generally pursued to address mental health challenges, psychological change is often hampered by non-adherence to treatments, relapses, and practical barriers (e.g., time, cost). In recent decades, Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have emerged as promising tools to directly target dysfunctional neural circuitry and promote long-lasting plastic changes. While the therapeutic efficacy of NIBS protocols for mental illnesses has been established, neuromodulatory interventions might also be employed to support the processes activated by psychotherapy. Indeed, combining psychotherapy with NIBS might help tailor the treatment to the patient's unique characteristics and therapeutic goal, and would allow more direct control of the neuronal changes induced by therapy. Herein, we overview emerging evidence on the use of NIBS to enhance the psychotherapeutic effect, while highlighting the next steps in advancing clinical and research methods toward personalized intervention approaches.

TI  - Falls in Synucleinopathies
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies, namely dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), are common degenerative neurological disorders that share synuclein pathology. Although certain cardinal features of parkinsonism, including bradykinesia and rigidity, respond well to levodopa, axial features, such as gait and balance impairment, are less reliably responsive to dopaminergic therapy and surgical interventions. Consequently, falls are common in PD and other synucleinopathies and are a major contributor toward injury and loss of independence. This underscores the need for appropriate fall risk assessment and implementation of preventative measures in all patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this review is therefore to explore modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for falls in synucleinopathies. We next review and evaluate the evidence for pharmacological, nonpharmacological, and surgical approaches for fall prevention, and emphasize individualized and multifaceted approaches.

TI  - History of ALS and the competing theories on pathogenesis: IFCN handbook chapter
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY PRACTICE
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the human motor system, first described in the 19th Century. The etiology of ALS appears to be multifactorial, with a complex interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors underlying the onset of disease. Importantly, there are no known naturally occurring animal models, and transgenic mouse models fail to faithfully reproduce ALS as it manifests in patients. Debate as to the site of onset of ALS remain, with three competing theories proposed, including (i) the dying-forward hypothesis, whereby motor neuron degeneration is mediated by hyperexcitable corticomotoneurons via an anterograde transsynaptic excitotoxic mechanism, (ii) dying-back hypothesis, proposing the ALS begins in the peripheral nervous system with a toxic factor(s) retrogradely transported into the central nervous system and mediating upper motor neuron dysfunction, and (iii) independent hypothesis, suggesting that upper and lower motor neuron degenerated independently. Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, along with pathological and genetic findings have supported the dying forward hypothesis theory, although the science is yet to be settled. The review provides a historical overview of ALS, discusses phenotypes and likely pathogenic mechanisms.

TI  - Diagnostics of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Up to Date
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by gradual loss of upper and lower motor neurons and their pathways, usually without affecting the extraocular and sphincter muscles. The cause of the disease is not yet known. It is a chain of subsequent events, ending in programmed cell death in selective neuronal subpopulations. The prognosis for survival is rather short with a median of 2 to 4 years. Survival may be prolonged based on prompt diagnosis, ALS subtype and proper management with supportive treatment (tracheostomy, gastrostomy, etc.). According to the clinical picture, the typical form of ALS with upper and lower motoneuron involvement and progressive bulbar paralysis with bulbar muscle involvement is observed. The ALS form with progressive muscle atrophy, where only the lower motoneuron is affected, and primary lateral sclerosis with only upper motoneuron damage are rare. Familiar forms of ALS (FALS) associated with specific genes (the most common is C9orf72) have been discovered. FALS is usually associated with dementia (frontotemporal lobar dementia, FTLD), behavioral disorders, cognitive dysfunction and impairment of executive functions. The diagnosis of ALS is determined by excluding other conditions and utilizing clinical examinations, laboratory and genetic tests and nerve conduction/needle electromyography studies (EMG). Needle EMG records abnormal activities at rest and looks for neurogenic patterns during muscle contraction. Motor evoked potentials after transcranial magnetic stimulation remain the test of choice to identify impairment of upper motor neurons. New biochemical, neurophysiological and morphological biomarkers are extensively studied as early diagnostic and prognostic factors and have implications for clinical trials, research and drug development.

TI  - Repeated Sub-Concussive Impacts and the Negative Effects of Contact Sports on Cognition and Brain Integrity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Sports are yielding a wealth of benefits for cardiovascular fitness, for psychological resilience, and for cognition. The amount of practice, and the type of practiced sports, are of importance to obtain these benefits and avoid any side effects. This is especially important in the context of contact sports. Contact sports are not only known to be a major source of injuries of the musculoskeletal apparatus, they are also significantly related to concussion and sub-concussion. Sub-concussive head impacts accumulate throughout the active sports career, and thus can cause measurable deficits and changes to brain health. Emerging research in the area of cumulative sub-concussions in contact sports has revealed several associated markers of brain injury. For example, recent studies discovered that repeated headers in soccer not only cause measurable signs of cognitive impairment but are also related to a prolonged cortical silent period in transcranial magnetic stimulation measurements. Other cognitive and neuroimaging biomarkers are also pointing to adverse effects of heading. A range of fluid biomarkers completes the picture of cumulating effects of sub-concussive impacts. Those accumulating effects can cause significant cognitive impairment later in life of active contact sportswomen and men. The aim of this review is to highlight the current scientific evidence on the effects of repeated sub-concussive head impacts on contact sports athletes' brains, identify the areas in need of further investigation, highlight the potential of advanced neuroscientific methods, and comment on the steps governing bodies have made to address this issue. We conclude that there are indeed neural and biofluid markers that can help better understand the effects of repeated sub-concussive head impacts and that some aspects of contact sports should be redefined, especially in situations where sub-concussive impacts and concussions can be minimized.

TI  - Treatment for Lexical Retrieval Impairments in Primary Progressive Aphasia: A Research Update with Implications for Clinical Practice
T2  - SEMINARS IN SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB  - Lexical retrieval impairments (also known as anomia or word-finding deficits) are an early and prominent symptom in primary progressive aphasia (PPA), causing distress and frustration to individuals with PPA and their communication partners, and prompting research on lexical retrieval treatment. This paper reviews the research on lexical retrieval treatment in PPA from the earliest reports in the 1990s to early 2018 and considers the implications of this research for clinical practice. The number of published studies has increased markedly over the past decade, consisting primarily of behavioral studies, with rapid recent growth in noninvasive brain stimulation studies. Five general treatment techniques were identified in the behavioral studies, described here as standard naming treatment, Look, Listen, Repeat treatment, cueing hierarchies, semantically focused treatments, and lexical retrieval in context. Across techniques, behavioral studies targeting difficult-to-retrieve items typically report immediate gains, and there is evidence these gains can be maintained over months to years by some participants who continue with long-term treatment. There is also evidence that prophylactic treatment supports retrieval of treated items compared with untreated items. There is limited evidence for generalization of treatment to untreated items, suggesting the primary aim of lexical retrieval treatment in this population is to maintain retrieval of a core vocabulary for as long as possible. Language and cognitive assessment and piloting of the intended treatment can inform decisions about treatment selection and participant suitability for long-term lexical retrieval treatment. The paper concludes with some questions to guide clinical decision making about whether to implement or continue with a behavioral lexical retrieval treatment.

TI  - Neurotechnologies as tools for cognitive rehabilitation in stroke patients
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Introduction Cognitive impairments are one of the most common remaining symptoms after a stroke. The use of neurotechnologies to enhance cognitive performance is a rapidly emerging field with encouraging results. Areas covered Here, the authors empirically review the respective literature and critically discuss the technologies that are currently most often used for cognitive enhancement in stroke patients, which are computerized cognitive training, virtual reality, noninvasive brain stimulation and brain-computer interfaces. The authors describe their advantages/disadvantages and the challenges and limitations to overcome. Expert opinion Although the current results are promising, more research is needed to be able to make conclusive statements and translate these approaches successfully in daily clinical life. Multidiscipline collaborations could aid to improve current neurotechnologies and provide guidelines for future implementations.

TI  - The role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and its single nucleotide polymorphisms in stroke patients
T2  - NEUROLOGIA I NEUROCHIRURGIA POLSKA
AB  - Stroke is the main cause of motoric and neuropsychological disability in adults. Recent advances in research into the role of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor in neuroplasticity, neuroprotection and neurogenesis might provide important information for the development of new poststroke-rehabilitation strategies. It plays a role as a mediator in motor learning and rehabilitation after stroke. Concentrations of BDNF are lower in acute ischemic-stroke patients compared to controls. Lower levels of BDNF are correlated with an increased risk of stroke, worse functional outcomes and higher mortality. BDNF signalling is dependent on the genetic variation which could affect an individual's response to recovery after stroke.
   Several single nucleotide polymorphisms of the BDNF gene have been studied with regard to stroke patients, but most papers analyse the rs6265 which results in a change from valine to methionine in the precursor protein. Subsequently a reduction in BDNF activity is observed. There are studies indicating the role of this polymorphism in brain plasticity, functional and morphological changes in the brain. It may affect the risk of ischemic stroke, post-stroke outcomes and the efficacy of the rehabilitation process within physical exercise and transcranial magnetic stimulation. There is a consistent trend of Met alleles' being connected with worse outcomes and prognoses after stroke. However, there is no satisfactory data confirming the importance of Met allele in stroke epidemiology and the post-stroke rehabilitation process. We present the current data on the role of BDNF and polymorphisms of the BDNF gene in stroke patients, concentrating on human studies. (C) 2017 Polish Neurological Society.

TI  - Resident tissue macrophages: Key coordinators of tissue homeostasis beyond immunity
T2  - SCIENCE IMMUNOLOGY
AB  - Resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) encompass a highly diverse set of cells abundantly present in every tissue and organ. RTMs are recognized as central players in innate immune responses, and more recently their importance beyond host defense has started to be highlighted. Despite sharing a universal name and several canonical markers, RTMs perform remarkably specialized activities tailored to sustain critical homeostatic functions of the organs they reside in. These cells can mediate neuronal communication, participate in metabolic pathways, and secrete growth factors. In this Review, we summarize how the division of labor among different RTM subsets helps support tissue homeostasis. We discuss how the local microenvironment influences the development of RTMs, the molecular processes they support, and how dysregulation of RTMs can lead to disease. Last, we highlight both the similarities and tissue-specific distinctions of key RTM subsets, aiming to coalesce recent classifications and perspectives into a unified view.

TI  - The Differential Contributions of Conceptual Representation Format and Language Structure to Levels of Semantic Abstraction Capacity
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
AB  - This paper reviews some controversies concerning the original and revised versions of the 'hub-and-spoke' model of conceptual representations and their implication for abstraction capacity levels. The 'hub-and-spoke' model, which is based on data gathered in patients with semantic dementia (SD), is the most authoritative model of conceptual knowledge. Patterson et al.'s (Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 8(12), 976-987, 2007) classical version of this model maintained that conceptual representations are stored in a unitary 'amodal' format in the right and left anterior temporal lobes (ATLs), because in SD the semantic disorder cuts across modalities and categories. Several authors questioned the unitary nature of these representations. They showed that the semantic impairment is 'multi-modal'only in the advanced stages of SD, when atrophy affects the ATLs bilaterally, but that impariments can be modality-specific in lateralised (early) stages of the disease. In these cases, SD mainly affects lexical-semantic knowledge when atrophy predominates on the left side and pictorial representations when atrophy prevails on the right side. Some aspects of the model (i.e. the importance of spokes, the multimodal format of representations and the graded convergence of modalities within the ATLs), which had already been outlined by Rogers et al. (Psychological Review, 111(1), 205-235, 2004) in a computational model of SD, were strengthened by these results. The relevance of these theoretical problems and of empirical data concerning the neural substrate of concrete and abstract words is discussed critically. The conclusion of the review is that the highest levels of abstraction are due more to the structuring influence of language than to the format of representations.

TI  - The Central Mechanisms of Resistance Training and Its Effects on Cognitive Function
T2  - SPORTS MEDICINE
AB  - Resistance exercise is used extensively in athletic and general populations to induce neuromuscular adaptations to increase muscle size and performance. Exercise parameters such as exercise frequency, intensity, duration and modality are carefully manipulated to induce specific adaptations to the neuromuscular system. While the benefits of resistance exercise on the neuromuscular system are well documented, there is growing evidence to suggest that resistance exercise, even when performed acutely, can lead to neuroplastic changes within the central nervous system (CNS) and improve cognitive functioning. As such, resistance exercise has been proposed as a novel adjuvant rehabilitation strategy in populations that suffer from neurological or neurocognitive impairments (i.e. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's dementia) or even to attenuate age-related declines in cognitive health. In this review, we present evidence for the neuroplastic effects and cognitive benefits of resistance exercise and propose some of the underlying mechanisms that drive neuroplasticity following resistance training. We will further discuss the effects of exercise parameters, in particular exercise frequency, intensity, duration and modality to improve cognitive health. Lastly, we will highlight some of the existing limitations in the literature surrounding the use of resistance exercise to improve cognitive function and propose considerations to improve future studies in this field. In summary, the current evidence supports the role of resistance exercise, as a stand alone or in combination with aerobic exercise, for benefiting cognitive health and that it should be considered as an adjuvant therapy to treat age- or disease-related cognitive declines.

AB  - Depression is a common mental disorder characterized by heterogeneous cog-nitive and behavioral symptoms. The emerging research paradigm of functional connectomics has provided a quantitative theoretical framework and analytic tools for parsing variations in the organization and function of brain networks in depression. In this review, we first discuss recent progress in depression -associated functional connectome variations. We then discuss treatment -specific brain network outcomes in depression and propose a hypothetical model highlighting the advantages and uniqueness of each treatment in relation to the modulation of specific brain network connectivity and symptoms of de-pression. Finally, we look to the future promise of combining multiple treatment types in clinical practice, using multisite datasets and multimodal neuroimaging approaches, and identifying biological depression subtypes.

TI  - Psychosis in Later Life: A Review and Update
T2  - HARVARD REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Psychosis is relatively common in later life and can present in a wide variety of contexts, including early-onset and late-onset schizophrenia, delusional disorder, mood disorders, and various dementias. It can also occur as the result of numerous medical and neurological diseases and from the use of certain medications. Although identifying the cause of psychosis in older patients can be challenging, the unique clinical features associated with the different disorders can help in making the diagnosis. Accurate diagnosis of psychosis in older populations is essential, as its treatment varies depending on the context in which it appears. Despite the safety concerns regarding the use of antipsychotics in older patients, certain pharmacological treatments appear to be both efficacious and reasonably safe in treating psychosis in older populations. Additionally, although research is limited, numerous psychosocial therapies appear promising. This review summarizes the literature on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, neuroimaging, and treatment of psychosis in later life, and serves as an update to past reviews on this topic.

TI  - Oscillatory Activities in Neurological Disorders of Elderly: Biomarkers to Target for Neuromodulation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been under investigation as adjunct treatment of various neurological disorders with variable success. One challenge is the limited knowledge on what would be effective neuronal targets for an intervention, combined with limited knowledge on the neuronal mechanisms of NIBS. Motivated on the one hand by recent evidence that oscillatory activities in neural systems play a role in orchestrating brain functions and dysfunctions, in particular those of neurological disorders specific of elderly patients, and on the other hand that NIBS techniques may be used to interact with these brain oscillations in a controlled way, we here explore the potential of modulating brain oscillations as an effective strategy for clinical NIBS interventions. We first review the evidence for abnormal oscillatory profiles to be associated with a range of neurological disorders of elderly (e.g., Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, epilepsy), and for these signals of abnormal network activity to normalize with treatment, and/or to be predictive of disease progression or recovery. We then ask the question to what extent existing NIBS protocols have been tailored to interact with these oscillations and possibly associated dysfunctions. Our review shows that, despite evidence for both reliable neurophysiological markers of specific oscillatory dis-functionalities in neurological disorders and NIBS protocols potentially able to interact with them, there are few applications of NIBS aiming to explore clinical outcomes of this interaction. Our review article aims to point out oscillatory markers of neurological, which are also suitable targets for modification by NIBS, in order to facilitate in future studies the matching of technical application to clinical targets.

TI  - Review, analyses, and comparisons of interventions in active and completed clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease
T2  - UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Alzheimer's disease is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder causing deteriorating cognitive function and memory loss. The purpose of this paper is to create a comparable landscape of completed and current clinical trials and therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's disease, identifying future hallmarks of neurodegenerative research. In the status quo, the urgency for new drugs and interventions surges as the aging population and cases of cognitive impairment grow. Current FDA-approved drugs have only decreased disease progression slightly; these drugs last for brief periods and are useful for symptom management rather than reversing pathogenesis. Through the data compilation, intervention analysis, and the corresponding figures that provide a visual perspective of the respective trends, this review article effectively identifies the developments and gaps for intervention in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. The methodology follows the specific guidelines and reporting standards of the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Moreover, inclusion and exclusion criteria were centered upon publication date, trial results, and a multitude of keyword searches pertaining to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment. Based on the review of clinical trials and literature precedent, descriptions of advancements are provided. Examples of these developments include the new interventions of stem cell therapy and declining trend of active immunotherapeutics. Trial details about the specific interventions were compiled using the ClinicalTrials.Gov database. Analysis of pending and completed trials are discussed based on advancements in Alzheimer's disease research and the progression of drug development.

TI  - Astrocytes as a Therapeutic Target in Alzheimer's Disease-Comprehensive Review and Recent Developments
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a frequent and disabling neurodegenerative disorder, in which astrocytes participate in several pathophysiological processes including neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism (along with a critical role in apolipoprotein E function). Current evidence shows that astrocytes have both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects depending on the disease stage and microenvironmental factors. Furthermore, astrocytes appear to be affected by the presence of amyloid-beta (A beta), with alterations in calcium levels, gliotransmission and proinflammatory activity via RAGE-NF-kappa B pathway. In addition, astrocytes play an important role in the metabolism of tau and clearance of A beta through the glymphatic system. In this review, we will discuss novel pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments focused on astrocytes as therapeutic targets for AD. These interventions include effects on anti-inflammatory/antioxidant systems, glutamate activity, lipid metabolism, neurovascular coupling and glymphatic system, calcium dysregulation, and in the release of peptides which affects glial and neuronal function. According to the AD stage, these therapies may be of benefit in either preventing or delaying the progression of the disease.

TI  - Induction of specific brain oscillations may restore neural circuits and be used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Brain oscillations underlie the function of our brains, dictating how we both think and react to the world around us. The synchronous activity of neurons generates these rhythms, which allow different parts of the brain to communicate and orchestrate responses to internal and external stimuli. Perturbations of cognitive rhythms and the underlying oscillator neurons that synchronize different parts of the brain contribute to the pathophysiology of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy and other diseases of rhythm that have been studied extensively by Gyorgy Buzsaki. In this review, we discuss how neurologists manipulate brain oscillations with neuromodulation to treat diseases and how this can be leveraged to improve cognition and pathology underlying AD. While multiple modalities of neuromodulation are currently clinically indicated for some disorders, nothing is yet approved for improving memory in AD. Recent investigations into novel methods of neuromodulation show potential for improving cognition in memory disorders. Here, we demonstrate that neuronal stimulation using audiovisual sensory stimulation that generated 40-HZ gamma waves reduced AD-specific pathology and improved performance in behavioural tests in mouse models of AD, making this new mode of neuromodulation a promising new avenue for developing a new therapeutic intervention for the treatment of dementia.

TI  - Facilitatory non-invasive brain stimulation in older adults: the effect of stimulation type and duration on the induction of motor cortex plasticity
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Despite holding significant promise for counteracting the deleterious effects of ageing on cognitive and motor function, little is known of the effects of facilitatory non-invasive brain stimulation (NBS) techniques on corticospinal excitability (CSE) in older adults. Thirty-three older adults (aeyen60 years) participated in four NBS sessions on separate days, receiving 10- and 20-min anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS), and 300 and 600 pulses of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) over the left M1. Motor-evoked potentials measured in the contralateral hand served as a measure of CSE before and for 30 min following each NBS intervention. At the group level, generalized post-stimulation CSE increases were observed (p < 0.001) with no significant differences between the two durations of each stimulation type (atDCS: p = 0.5; iTBS: p = 0.9). For individuals exhibiting overall facilitatory change to atDCS ('responders', n = 10), 20-min atDCS resulted in longer lasting CSE facilitation than 10 min. No such difference was observed between the two iTBS protocols. Considerable variability was observed inter-individually, where 52-58 % of the cohort exhibited the expected facilitation after each of the NBS protocols-as well as intra-individually, where 45-48 % of the cohort maintained consistent post-stimulation responses across the varying durations and types of stimulation. In conclusion, as shown previously in young adults, older adults demonstrate substantial variability in response to different facilitatory NBS protocols. Studies to assess the intra-individual reliability of these protocols are critical to progress towards translation of appropriate protocols (i.e. those that elicit the greatest response for each individual) into clinical practice.

TI  - Approach to Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease
T2  - NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Cognitive dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and predicts poor clinical outcomes. It is associated primarily with pathologic involvement of basal forebrain cholinergic and prefrontal dopaminergic systems. Impairments in executive functions, attention, and visuospatial abilities are its hallmark features with eventual involvement of memory and other domains. Subtle symptoms in the premotor and early phases of PD progress to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which may be present at the time of diagnosis. Eventually, a large majority of PD patients develop dementia with advancing age and longer disease duration, which is usually accompanied by immobility, hallucinations/psychosis, and dysautonomia. Dopaminergic medications and deep brain stimulation help motor dysfunction, but may have potential cognitive side effects. Central acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and possibly memantine, provide modest and temporary symptomatic relief for dementia, although there is no evidence-based treatment for MCI. There is no proven disease-modifying treatment for cognitive impairment in PD. The symptomatic and disease-modifying role of physical exercise, cognitive training, and neuromodulation on cognitive impairment in PD is under investigation. Multidisciplinary approaches to cognitive impairment with effective treatment of comorbidities, proper rehabilitation, and maintenance of good support systems in addition to pharmaceutical treatment may improve the quality of life of the patients and caregivers.

TI  - Apathy associated with neurocognitive disorders: Recent progress and future directions
T2  - ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA
AB  - Introduction: Apathy is common in neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) such as Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Although the definition of apathy is inconsistent in the literature, apathy is primarily defined as a loss of motivation and decreased interest in daily activities.
   Methods: The Alzheimer's Association International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART) Neuropsychiatric Syndromes Professional Interest Area (NPS-PIA) Apathy workgroup reviewed the latest research regarding apathy in NCDs.
   Results: Progress has recently been made in three areas relevant to apathy: (I) phenomenology, including the use of diagnostic criteria and novel instruments for measurement, (2) neurobiology, including neuroimaging, neuropathological and biomarker correlates, and (3) interventions, including pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and noninvasive neuromodulatory approaches.
   Discussion: Recent progress confirms that apathy has a significant impact on those with major NCD and those with mild NCDs. As such, it is an important target for research and intervention. (C) 2016 the Alzheimer's Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Audiovisual gamma stimulation for the treatment of neurodegeneration
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease and a health challenge with major social and economic consequences. In this review, we discuss the therapeutic potential of gamma stimulation in treating AD and delve into the possible mechanisms responsible for its positive effects. Recent studies reveal that it is feasible and safe to induce 40 Hz brain activity in AD patients through a range of 40 Hz multisensory and noninvasive electrical or magnetic stimulation methods. Although research into the clinical potential of these interventions is still in its nascent stages, these studies suggest that 40 Hz stimulation can yield beneficial effects on brain function, disease pathology, and cognitive function in individuals with AD. Specifically, we discuss studies involving 40 Hz light, auditory, and vibrotactile stimulation, as well as noninvasive techniques such as transcranial alternating current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The precise mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects of gamma stimulation in AD are not yet fully elucidated, but preclinical studies have provided relevant insights. We discuss preclinical evidence related to both neuronal and nonneuronal mechanisms that may be involved, touching upon the relevance of interneurons, neuropeptides, and specific synaptic mechanisms in translating gamma stimulation into widespread neuronal activity within the brain. We also explore the roles of microglia, astrocytes, and the vasculature in mediating the beneficial effects of gamma stimulation on brain function. Lastly, we examine upcoming clinical trials and contemplate the potential future applications of gamma stimulation in the management of neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Clinical evoked potentials in neurology: a review of techniques and indications
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Evoked potentials (EPs) are a powerful and cost-effective tool for evaluating the integrity and function of the central nervous system. Although imaging techniques, such as MRI, have recently become increasingly important in the diagnosis of neurological diseases, over the past 30 years, many neurologists have continued to employ EPs in specific clinical applications. This review presents an overview of the recent evolution of 'classical' clinical applications of EPs in terms of early diagnosis and disease monitoring and is an extension of a previous review published in this journal in 2005 by Walsh and collaborators. We also provide an update on emerging EPs based on gustatory, olfactory and pain stimulation that may be used as clinically relevant markers of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and cortical or peripheral impaired pain perception. EPs based on multichannel electroencephalography recordings, known as high-density EPs, help to better differentiate between healthy subjects and patients and, moreover, they provide valuable spatial information regarding the site of the lesion. EPs are reliable disease-progression biomarkers of several neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating disorders. Overall, EPs are excellent neurophysiological tools that will expand standard clinical practice in modern neurology.

TI  - Brain Networks Involved in Sensory Perception in Parkinson's Disease: A Scoping Review
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) has historically been considered a disorder of motor dysfunction. However, a growing number of studies have demonstrated sensory abnormalities in PD across the modalities of proprioceptive, tactile, visual, auditory and temporal perception. A better understanding of these may inform future drug and neuromodulation therapy. We analysed these studies using a scoping review. In total, 101 studies comprising 2853 human participants (88 studies) and 125 animals (13 studies), published between 1982 and 2022, were included. These highlighted the importance of the basal ganglia in sensory perception across all modalities, with an additional role for the integration of multiple simultaneous sensation types. Numerous studies concluded that sensory abnormalities in PD result from increased noise in the basal ganglia and increased neuronal receptive field size. There is evidence that sensory changes in PD and impaired sensorimotor integration may contribute to motor abnormalities.

TI  - Treatment of limb apraxia - Moving forward to improved action
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION
AB  - Limb apraxia is a common disorder of skilled, purposive movement that is frequently associated with stroke and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. Despite evidence that several types of limb apraxia significantly impact functional abilities, surprisingly few studies have focused on development of treatment paradigms. Additionally, although the most disabling types of apraxia reflect damage to gesture and/or object memory systems, existing treatments have not fully taken advantage of principles of experience known to affect learning and neural plasticity. We review the current state of the art in the rehabilitation of limb apraxia, indicate possible points of contact with the learning literature, and generate suggestions for how translational principles might be applied to the development of future research on treatment of this disabling disorder.

TI  - Biomarkers in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: current status and future prospects
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS NEUROLOGY
AB  - Disease heterogeneity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis poses a substantial challenge in drug development. Categorization based on clinical features alone can help us predict the disease course and survival, but quantitative measures are also needed that can enhance the sensitivity of the clinical categorization. In this Review, we describe the emerging landscape of diagnostic, categorical and pharmacodynamic biomarkers in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and their place in the rapidly evolving landscape of new therapeutics. Fluid-based markers from cerebrospinal fluid, blood and urine are emerging as useful diagnostic, pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers. Combinations of imaging measures have the potential to provide important diagnostic and prognostic information, and neurophysiological methods, including various electromyography-based measures and quantitative EEG-magnetoencephalography-evoked responses and corticomuscular coherence, are generating useful diagnostic, categorical and prognostic markers. Although none of these biomarker technologies has been fully incorporated into clinical practice or clinical trials as a primary outcome measure, strong evidence is accumulating to support their clinical utility.
   This Review describes the emerging landscape of diagnostic, categorical and pharmacodynamic biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and considers the role of these biomarkers in the rapidly evolving landscape of new therapeutics for this condition.
   The heterogeneity in both the clinical presentation and underlying pathobiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in humans has limited the translation from preclinical models to successful clinical trials.Disease categorization might be improved using ancillary and companion measures. Such biomarkers can serve diagnostic, categorical and prognostic functions.Biomarkers that are closest to use in the clinical domain include neurofilaments, which can be measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid.Promising emerging biomarkers include those derived from neurophysiological assessment such as quantitative EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation.No single biomarker modality will adequately cover all of the diagnostic, categorical prognostic and pharmacodynamic requirements to support the successful development of novel therapeutics.The future landscape is likely to both integrate different biomarker modalities and use deep learning and artificial intelligence to fully address the complexity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

TI  - Mapping distributed sources of cortical rhythms in mild Alzheimer's disease. A multicentric EEG study
T2  - NEUROIMAGE
AB  - The study aimed at mapping (i) the distributed electroencephalographic (EEG) sources specific for mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to vascular dementia (VaD) or normal elderly people (Nold) and (ii) the distributed EEG sources sensitive to the mild AD at different stages of severity. Resting EEG (10-20 electrode montage) was recorded from 48 mild AD, 20 VaD, and 38 Nold subjects. Both AD and VaD patients had 24-17 of mini mental state examination (MMSE). EEG rhythms were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). Cortical EEG sources were modeled by low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Regarding issue i, there was a decline of central, parietal, temporal, and limbic alpha 1 (low alpha) sources specific for mild AD group with respect to Nold and VaD groups. Furthermore, occipital alpha 1 sources showed a strong decline in mild AD compared to VaD group. Finally, distributed theta sources were largely abnormal in VaD but not in mild AD group. Regarding issue ii, there was a lower power of occipital alpha 1 sources in mild AD subgroup having more severe disease. Compared to previous field studies, this was the first investigation that illustrated the power spectrum profiles at the level of cortical (macroregions) EEG sources in mild AD patients having different severity of the disease with respect to VaD and normal subjects. Future studies should evaluate the clinical usefulness of this approach in early differential diagnosis, disease staging, and therapy monitoring. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - BIOCYBERNETICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures the neuronal activities in the form of electric currents that are generated due to the synchronized activity by a group of specialized pyramidal cells inside the brain. The study presents a brief comparison of various functional neuroimaging techniques, revealing the excellent neuroimaging capabilities of EEG signals such as high temporal resolution, inexpensiveness, portability, and non-invasiveness as compared to the other techniques such as positron emission tomography, magnetoencephalogram, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Different types of frequency bands associated with the brain signals are also being summarized. The main purpose of this literature survey is to cover the maximum possible applications of EEG signals based on computer-aided technologies, ranging from the diagnosis of various neurological disorders such as epilepsy, major depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, and dementia to the monitoring of other applications such as motor imagery, identity authentication, emotion recognition, sleep stage classi fication, eye state detection, and drowsiness monitoring. After reviewing them, the comparative analysis of the publicly available EEG datasets and other local data acquisition methods, preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, and the result analysis through the classi fication models and statistical tests has been presented. Then the research gaps and future directions in the present studies have been summarized with the aim to inspire the readers to explore more opportunities on the current topic.

TI  - Apathy after stroke: Diagnosis, mechanisms, consequences, and treatment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE
AB  - Apathy is a reduction in goal-directed activity in the cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or social domains of a patient's life and occurs in one out of three patients after stroke. Despite this, apathy is clinically under-recognized and poorly understood. This overview provides a contemporary introduction to apathy in stroke for researchers and practitioners, covering topics including diagnosis, neurobiological mechanisms, associated consequences, and potential treatments for apathy. Apathy is often misdiagnosed as other post-stroke conditions such as depression. Accurate differential diagnosis of apathy, which manifests as reductions in initiative, and depression, which manifests as negative emotionality, is important as it informs prognosis. Research on the neurobiology of apathy suggests that there are few consistent associations between stroke lesion location and the development of apathy. These may be resolved by adopting a network neuroscience approach, which models apathy as a pathology arising from structural or functional damage to brain networks underlying motivated behavior. Importantly, networks can be affected by physiological changes related to stroke, including the acute infarct but also diaschisis and neurodegeneration. Aside from neurobiological changes, apathy is also associated with other negative outcome measures such as functional disability, cognitive impairment, and emotional distress, suggesting that apathy is indicative of a worse prognosis following stroke. Unfortunately, high-quality trials aimed at treating apathy are scarce. Antidepressants may have limited effects on apathy. Acetylcholine and dopamine pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, and transcranial magnetic stimulation may be more promising avenues for treatment.

TI  - Tackling seizures in patients with Alzheimer's disease
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - IntroductionIn past years, a possible bidirectional link between epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been proposed: if AD patients are more likely to develop epilepsy, people with late-onset epilepsy evidence an increased risk of dementia. Furthermore, current research suggested that subclinical epileptiform discharges may be more frequent in patients with AD and network hyperexcitability may hasten cognitive impairment.Areas coveredIn this narrative review, the authors discuss the recent evidence linking AD and epilepsy as well as seizures semeiology and epileptiform activity observed in patients with AD. Finally, anti-seizure medications (ASMs) and therapeutic trials to tackle seizures and network hyperexcitability in this clinical scenario have been summarized.Expert opinionThere is growing experimental evidence demonstrating a strong connection between seizures, neuronal hyperexcitability, and AD. Epilepsy in AD has shown a good response to ASMs both at the late and prodromal stages. The new generation ASMs with fewer cognitive adverse effects seem to be a preferable option. Data on the possible effects of network hyperexcitability and ASMs on AD progression are still inconclusive. Further clinical trials are mandatory to identify clear guidelines about treatment of subclinical epileptiform discharges in patients with AD without seizures.

TI  - A Review of Therapeutics for Treatment-Resistant Depression in the Older Adult
T2  - DRUGS & AGING
AB  - One-third of older adults with depression meet criteria for treatment resistance, typically defined as a lack of response to two or more adequate trials of an antidepressant. Treatment resistance contributes to an unfavorable prognosis, compromised medical outcomes, heightened disability, accelerated cognitive decline, and an elevated risk of developing dementia. Despite this significant morbidity, evidence is sparse for how to proceed with treatment in this population. Non-pharmacologic therapy (e.g., diet, psychotherapy) can be utilized as adjunctive therapy, despite little published evidence of benefit, given that the risks are low. Pharmacotherapy trials in the treatment-resistant late-life depression population lack strong methods and external validity; however, the use of venlafaxine as monotherapy and add-on therapy, as well as lithium, bupropion, or aripiprazole as add-on therapy to standard antidepressant therapy, have enough evidence that a trial with appropriate monitoring is a prudent strategy. Electroconvulsive therapy remains a well-studied safe therapy, especially when used as maintenance treatment once an initial cycle is completed but is traditionally underutilized in the treatment-resistant late-life depression population. Ensuring non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies are optimized and given a sufficient trial in those with treatment-resistant late-life depression is the best we can do for this vulnerable population.

TI  - Compensatory mechanisms in Parkinson's disease: Circuits adaptations and role in disease modification
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY
AB  - The motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) are well known to manifest only when striatal dopaminergic deficit reaches 60-70%. Thus, PD has a long pre-symptomatic and pre-motor evolution during which compensatory mechanisms take place to delay the clinical onset of disabling manifestations. Classic compensatory mechanisms have been attributed to changes and adjustments in the nigro-striatal system, such as increased neuronal activity in the substantia nigra pars compacta and enhanced dopamine synthesis and release in the striatum. However, it is not so clear currently that such changes occur early enough to account for the pre-symptomatic period. Other possible mechanisms relate to changes in basal ganglia and motor cortical circuits including the cerebellum. However, data from early PD patients are difficult to obtain as most studies have been carried out once the diagnosis and treatments have been established. Likewise, putative compensatory mechanisms taking place throughout disease evolution are nearly impossible to distinguish by themselves. Here, we review the evidence for the role of the best known and other possible compensatory mechanisms in PD. We also discuss the possibility that, although beneficial in practical terms, compensation could also play a deleterious role in disease progression.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, clinically defined by progressive cognitive decline and pathologically, by brain atrophy, neuroinflammation, and accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Neurotechnological approaches, including optogenetics and deep brain stimulation, have exploded as new tools for not only the study of the brain but also for application in the treatment of neurological diseases. Here, we review the current state of AD therapeutics and recent advancements in both invasive and non-invasive neurotechnologies that can be used to ameliorate AD pathology, including neurostimulation via optogenetics, photobiomodulation, electrical stimulation, ultrasound stimulation, and magnetic neurostimulation, as well as nanotechnologies employing nanovectors, magnetic nanoparticles, and quantum dots. We also discuss the current challenges in developing these neurotechnological tools and the prospects for implementing them in the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Functional relevance of resistance training-induced neuroplasticity in health and disease
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Repetitive, monotonic, and effortful voluntary muscle contractions performed for just a few weeks, i.e., resistance training, can substantially increase maximal voluntary force in the practiced task and can also increase gross motor performance. The increase in motor performance is often accompanied by neuroplastic adaptations in the central nervous system. While historical data assigned functional relevance to such adaptations induced by resistance training, this claim has not yet been systematically and critically examined in the context of motor performance across the lifespan in health and disease. A review of muscle activation, brain and peripheral nerve stimulation, and imaging data revealed that increases in motor performance and neuroplasticity tend to be uncoupled, making a mechanistic link between neuroplasticity and motor performance inconclusive. We recommend new approaches, including causal mediation analytical and hypothesis-driven models to substantiate the functional relevance of resistance training-induced neuroplasticity in the improvements of gross motor function across the lifespan in health and disease.

TI  - How Machine Learning is Powering Neuroimaging to Improve Brain Health
T2  - NEUROINFORMATICS
AB  - This report presents an overview of how machine learning is rapidly advancing clinical translational imaging in ways that will aid in the early detection, prediction, and treatment of diseases that threaten brain health. Towards this goal, we aresharing the information presented at a symposium, "Neuroimaging Indicators of Brain Structure and Function - Closing the Gap Between Research and Clinical Application", co-hosted by the McCance Center for Brain Health at Mass General Hospital and the MIT HST Neuroimaging Training Program on February 12, 2021. The symposium focused on the potential for machine learning approaches, applied to increasingly large-scale neuroimaging datasets, to transform healthcare delivery and change the trajectory of brain health by addressing brain care earlier in the lifespan. While not exhaustive, this overview uniquely addresses many of the technical challenges from image formation, to analysis and visualization, to synthesis and incorporation into the clinical workflow. Some of the ethical challenges inherent to this work are also explored, as are some of the regulatory requirements for implementation. We seek to educate, motivate, and inspire graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career investigators to contribute to a future where neuroimaging meaningfully contributes to the maintenance of brain health.

TI  - MRI-defined vascular depression: a review of the construct
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Objective: To review the construct of MRI-defined vascular depression and to examine the substantive and methodological issues that bear on its validity as a distinct subtype of depression in late life.
   Design: Literature review.
   Results: We identified three areas that are critical to establishing the validity of MRI-defined vascular depression: (1) understanding and delineating the relationship between MRI hyperintensities, executive dysfunction, and antidepressant treatment outcome; (2) understanding the relationship between, and establishing the validity of, qualitative and quantitative approaches to the measurement of MRI hyperintensities (the primary feature of the proposed subtype); (3) establishing the clinical presentation and course of the subtype in the context of other late-life disorders.
   Conclusions: Despite considerable data supporting the validity of MRI-defined vascular depression, there are a number of critical issues that remain, including establishing a causal relationship between cerebrovascular disease and late-life depression, establishing consistent diagnostic criteria, determining the importance of lesion type and location, and understanding the course of the disorder.

TI  - The Practicalities of Assessing Freezing of Gait
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARKINSONS DISEASE
AB  - Background: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a mysterious, complex and debilitating phenomenon in Parkinson's disease. Adequate assessment is a pre-requisite for managing FOG, as well as for assigning participants in FOG research. The episodic nature of FOG, as well as its multiple clinical expressions make its assessment challenging.
   Objective: To highlight the available assessment tools and to provide practical, experience-based recommendations for reliable assessment of FOG.
   Methods: We reviewed FOG assessment from history taking, questionnaires, lab and home-based measurements and examined how these methods account for presence and severity of FOG, their limits and advantages. The practicalities for their use in clinical and research practice are highlighted.
   Results: According to the available assessment tools severity of FOG is marked by one or a combination of multiple clinical expressions including frequency, duration, triggering circumstances, response to levodopa, association with falls and fear of falling, or need for assistance to avoid falls.
   Conclusions: To date, a unique methodological tool that encompasses the entire complexity of FOG is lacking. Combining methods should give a better picture of FOG severity, in accordance with the precise clinical or research context. Further development of any future assessment tool requires understanding and thorough analysis of the specific clinical expressions of FOG.

TI  - Modulating functional connectivity with non-invasive brain stimulation for the investigation and alleviation of age-associated declines in response inhibition: A narrative review
T2  - NEUROIMAGE
AB  - Response inhibition, the ability to withhold a dominant and prepotent response following a change in circumstance or sensory stimuli, declines with advancing age. While non-invasive brain stimulation (NiBS) has shown promise in alleviating some cognitive and motor functions in healthy older individuals, NiBS research focusing on response inhibition has mostly been conducted on younger adults. These extant studies have primarily focused on modulating the activity of distinct neural regions known to be critical for response inhibition, including the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). However, given that changes in structural and functional connectivity have been associated with healthy aging, this review proposes that NiBS protocols aimed at modulating the functional connectivity between the rIFG and pre-SMA may be the most efficacious approach to investigate-and perhaps even alleviate-age-related deficits in inhibitory control.

TI  - Enhancement of Declarative Memory: From Genetic Regulation to Non-invasive Stimulation
T2  - BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW
AB  - The problem of memory enhancement is extremely important in intellectual activity areas and therapy of different types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The attempts to solve this problem have come from different research fields. In the first part of our review, we describe the results of targeting certain genes involved in memory-associated molecular pathways. The second part of the review is focused on the deep stimulation of brain structures that can slow down memory loss in AD. The third part describes the results of the use of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques for memory modulation, consolidation, and retrieval in healthy people and animal models. Integration of data from different research fields is essential for the development of efficient strategies for memory enhancement.

TI  - Resting state cortical electroencephalographic rhythms are related to gray matter volume in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
T2  - HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING
AB  - Cortical gray matter volume and resting state cortical electroencephalographic rhythms are typically abnormal in subjects with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we tested the hypothesis that in amnesic MCI and AD subjects, abnormalities of EEG rhythms are a functional reflection of cortical atrophy across the disease. Eyes-closed resting state EEG data were recorded in 57 healthy elderly (Nold), 102 amnesic MCI, and 108 AD patients. Cortical gray matter volume was indexed by magnetic resonance imaging recorded in the MCI and AD subjects according to Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative project (http://www.adni-info.org/). EEG rhythms of interest were delta (24 Hz), theta (48 Hz), alpha1 (810.5 Hz), alpha2 (10.513 Hz), beta1 (1320 Hz), beta2 (2030 Hz), and gamma (3040 Hz). These rhythms were indexed by LORETA. Compared with the Nold, the MCI showed a decrease in amplitude of alpha 1 sources. With respect to the Nold and MCI, the AD showed an amplitude increase of delta sources, along with a strong amplitude reduction of alpha 1 sources. In the MCI and AD subjects as a whole group, the lower the cortical gray matter volume, the higher the delta sources, the lower the alpha 1 sources. The better the score to cognitive tests the higher the gray matter volume, the lower the pathological delta sources, and the higher the alpha sources. These results suggest that in amnesic MCI and AD subjects, abnormalities of resting state cortical EEG rhythms are not epiphenomena but are strictly related to neurodegeneration (atrophy of cortical gray matter) and cognition.

TI  - Association between Blood Pressure, Blood Pressure Variability, and Post-Stroke Cognitive Impairment
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
AB  - After stroke, dynamic changes take place from necrotic-apoptotic continuum, inflammatory response to poststroke neurogenesis, and remodeling of the network. These changes and baseline brain pathology such as small vessel disease (SVD) and amyloid burden may be associated with the occurrence of early or late poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) or dementia (PSD), which affect not only stroke victims but also their families and even society. We reviewed the current concepts and understanding of the pathophysiology for PSCI/PSD and identified useful tools for the diagnosis and the prediction of PSCI in serological, CSF, and image characteristics. Then, we untangled their relationships with blood pressure (BP) and blood pressure variability (BPV), important but often overlooked risk factors for PSCI/PSD. Finally, we provided evidence for the modifying effects of BP and BPV on PSCI as well as pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions and life style modification for PSCI/PSD prevention and treatment.

TI  - A Brief Comparative Look at Experimental Memory Editing Techniques for Cognitive Dysfunction
T2  - CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH
AB  - Neuroscience has long sought to develop methods that can "edit" or even "erase" memories, with the aim to provide treatments for memory-related neurological and psychiatric diseases such as anxiety and addiction. Current efforts are heavily focused on modifying cognitive behavioral therapy protocols or pharmacological treatments, but the efficacy and safety of these methods have been called into question by several studies. Advances in modern technology and the rapid emergence of techniques that can directly stimulate/alter neuronal activity, such as neuromodulation, have great potential in achieving the goal of memory modification for treating dementia such as Alzheimer's disease. However, more research and validation studies are required before these memory editing technologies can be applied clinically. In this mini-review, we compare and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of cognitive behavioral therapy, pharmacological methods, and neuromodulation techniques. We believe that neuromodulation techniques will play a key role in overcoming the challenges of translating memory-manipulating techniques to clinical applications.

TI  - Functional near infrared spectroscopy in psychiatry: a critical review
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY
AB  - This review deals with the utilisation of functional near infrared (fNIR) spectroscopy for an in vivo assessment of activation changes in brain tissue, which has broadened the range of non-invasive functional imaging methods within the field of neuroscientific research. Due to its simple and quick applicability as well as the absence of side effects, fNIR spectroscopy is particularly well tolerated by psychiatric patients and can hence markedly contribute to the understanding of the neurobiological basis of psychiatric disorders. The optical, light-based method emits near infrared wavelengths of about 700-1000 nm, which are able to penetrate the scalp and skull, into the head. Because near infrared light is distinctively absorbed by the chromophores oxy-haemoglobin (O(2)Hb) and deoxy-haemoglobin (HHb), the measured relative amount of reflected NIR light can indicate regional oxygenation patterns in cortical brain tissue with a depth resolution of, on average, 1.5 cm and a spatial resolution of about 2-3 cm. Validity and reliability of fNIR spectroscopy measurements to assess task-related cognitive activation have been repeatedly confirmed among healthy subjects. Beyond that, the application of fNIR spectroscopy to detect altered cortical oxygenation in psychiatric patients during cognitive tasks has been greatly intensified over the last two decades. In this context, hypo-frontality, a decrease in frontal lobe activity that is associated with a number of clinical symptoms and psychiatric disorders, has been demonstrated in a wide range of fNIR spectroscopy studies with psychiatric patients. Despite its variety of beneficial properties, the most apparent disadvantages of NIR spectroscopy compared to other imaging techniques are its limited spatial as well as depth resolution and its restriction to cortical areas. Although multimodal approaches based on simultaneous application of NIR spectroscopy combined with other imaging techniques initially revealed promising results, further technical development and a broadened implementation of combined measurements are necessary in order to uncover distinct brain activity alterations in different psychiatric disorders. In addition to the need for further technical improvement of the method, broad and longitudinal applications of fNIR spectroscopy measurements in psychiatric research are required in order to identify robust diagnostic markers which are required to establish NIR spectroscopy as a valid inter-individual screening instrument in psychiatry.

TI  - Identifying and responding to fatigue and apathy in Parkinson's disease: a review of current practice
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Introduction: Fatigue and apathy are two key non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), with documented negative impact on Quality of life (QoL) and a frequent burden for caregivers. Areas covered: In this review, the authors comment on the latest pathophysiology, clinical phenomenology, the most frequently used scales for fatigue and apathy in PD with a focus on available therapeutic strategies. Expert opinion:The identification of fatigue and apathy in PD is mainly hampered by the lack of a clear consensus on these subjective symptoms. The pathophysiological processes remain unclear, and the large variation in prevalence is likely due to the heterogeneous PD populations and the lack of an enriched cohort of people with fatigue and/or apathy as main symptoms. Treatment strategies, and especially level 1 evidence for specific treatments for fatigue and apathy in PD, remain scarce. The best evidence to date is doxepin, rasagiline and levodopa infusion therapy (for fatigue), and rivastigmine (for apathy). Further efforts should be made to properly identify these two major symptoms in PD, to correctly detect those who may benefit most from tailored personalized interventions.

TI  - Autosomal recessive adult-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated with homozygosity for Asp90Ala CuZn-superoxide dismutase mutation - A clinical and genealogical study of 36 patients
T2  - BRAIN
AB  - We describe 36 patients (six were apparently sporadic cases and 30 were cases from nine families) with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) characterized by a distinct phenotype associated with homozygosity for an Asp90Ala mutation in the CuZn-superoxide dismutase gene. The presenting motor manifestation in all patients was paresis in the legs, with slow progression to the upper extremities and finally to the bulbar muscles. The age of ALS onset varied from 20 to 94 years, with a mean of 44 years. Mean survival time was 13 years for the II deceased patients. However this is probably biased and untypical (low) when compared with the disease duration in the surviving patients, and when considering other medical complications in the deceased patients. The rate of progression was highly variable, even within families. All patients showed signs of involvement of both upper and lower motorneurons. Other neurological features included painful muscle spasms and paraesthesiae in the lower extremities. Two-thirds of patients experienced difficulty with micturition Electrophysiological studies confirmed the slow progression and spatial distribution of clinical symptoms in the peripheral motor system. Furthermore, EMG potentials evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (MEP) were compared with those evoked by cervical or lumbosacral electrical stimulation and often revealed marked slowing of transmission in central motor pathways. In Sweden and Finland ALS patients homozygous for the Asp90Ala mutation constitute a phenotypically characteristic subset of motor neuron disease.

TI  - The hallucinating brain: A review of structural and functional neuroimaging studies of hallucinations
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Hallucinations remains one of the most intriguing phenomena in psychopathology. In the past two decades the advent of neuroimaging techniques have allowed researchers to investigate what is happening in the brain of those who experience hallucinations. In this article we review both structural and functional neuroimaging studies of patients with auditory and visual hallucinations as well as a small number of studies that have assessed cognitive processes associated with hallucinations in healthy volunteers. The current literature suggests that in addition to secondary (and occasionally primary) sensory cortices, dysfunction in prefrontal premotor, cingulate, subcortical and cerebellar regions also seem to contribute to hallucinatory experiences. Based on the findings of these studies we tentatively propose a neurocognitive model in which both bottom-up and top-down processes interact to produce these erroneous percepts. Finally, directions for future work are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The polysemous concepts of psychomotricity and catatonia: A European multi-consensus perspective
T2  - EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - Current classification systems use the terms "catatonia" and "psychomotor phenomena" as mere a-theoretical descriptors, forgetting about their theoretical embedment. This was the source of misunderstandings among clinicians and researchers of the European collaboration on movement and sensorimotor/psychomotor functioning in schizophrenia and other psychoses or ECSP. Here, we review the different perspectives, their historical roots and highlight discrepancies.
   In 1844, Wilhelm Griesinger coined the term "psychic-motor" to name the physiological process accounting for volition. While deriving from this idea, the term "psychomotor" actually refers to systems that receive miscellaneous intrapsychic inputs, convert them into coherent behavioral outputs send to the motor systems. More recently, the sensorimotor approach has drawn on neuroscience to redefine the motor signs and symptoms observed in psychoses.
   In 1874, Karl Kahlbaum conceived catatonia as a brain disease emphasizing its somatic - particularly motor - features. In conceptualizing dementia praecox Emil Kraepelin rephrased catatonic phenomena in purely mental terms, putting aside motor signs which could not be explained in this way. Conversely, the Wernicke-Kleist-Leonhard school pursued Kahlbaum's neuropsychiatric approach and described many new psychomotor signs, e.g. parakinesias, Gegenhalten. They distinguished 8 psychomotor phenotypes of which only 7 are catatonias. These barely overlap with consensus classifications, raising the risk of misunderstanding.
   Although coming from different traditions, the authors agreed that their differences could be a source of mutual enrichment, but that an important effort of conceptual clarification remained to be made. This narrative review is a first step in this direction. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Deep brain stimulation for psychiatric disorders and behavioral/ cognitive-related indications: Review of the literature and implications for treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - While pharmacological and/or behavioral treatments are effective in managing symptoms for many patients with psychiatric diagnoses and disorders with behavioral/cognitive manifestations, a subset of individuals are treatment-refractory, unable to achieve appreciable benefit or symptom relief from traditional methods. In recent years, neuromodulation has gained momentum as an adjunctive treatment for improving outcomes in patients who are treatment-refractory. One form of neuromodulation, deep brain stimulation (DBS), has been investigated for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders and behavioral/cognitive symptoms. The following article provides a review of DBS investigations for several psychiatric and behavioral-related disorders, including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder, Alzheimer's disease, anorexia, obesity, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science were used to identify published articles, and Clinicaltrials.gov was used to identify currently ongoing or planned studies. Findings revealed the potential utility of DBS in improving outcomes for various psychiatric and behavioral/cognitive-related disorders. While promising, there are several limitations present in the available literature, and further well-designed clinical trials are necessary before conclusive decisions regarding the utility of DBS for the treatment of these psychiatric/behavioral/cognitive-related disorders can be made. Regardless, the studies included in this review demonstrate positive preliminary findings for the potential benefit of DBS for treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders, and further research is warranted to better determine the potential utility of DBS for those who are treatment-refractory and unable to achieve symptom relief with standard care.

TI  - Motor cortex stimulation for movement disorders
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) was introduced by Tsubokawa in 1991 (1) for the treatment of thalamic pain, after coming to the conclusion that the hyperactivity of thalamic neurons after spino-thalamic tractotomy was inhibited by stimulation of the motor cortex. MCS has been reported not only to be effective on pain, but also to improve movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, tremor, dystonia, poststroke movement disorders and hemiparesis. Most of these publications are case reports or small series, and the real impact of MCS on movement disorders remains to be determined.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: In order to clarify this point, we conducted a PubMed search from 1991 to 2016 using established MeSH words. A total of 40 papers were selected and examined. Furthermore, personal experience with MCS for Parkinson's disease and akinesia, is reported.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Only four studies were randomized controlled clinical trials: three out of four failed to demonstrate the efficacy of MCS at short term.
   CONCLUSIONS: At long term, MCS seems to show a clinical positive effect in the studies prolonged in an open observational trial.

TI  - Understanding the multidimensional cognitive deficits of logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia
T2  - BRAIN
AB  - In a new clinico-anatomical model, Ramanan et al. integrate advances from cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology to propose a role for left temporoparietal degeneration in underpinning emergent linguistic and non-linguistic cognitive deficits in logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia.
   The logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia is characterized by early deficits in language production and phonological short-term memory, attributed to left-lateralized temporoparietal, inferior parietal and posterior temporal neurodegeneration. Despite patients primarily complaining of language difficulties, emerging evidence points to performance deficits in non-linguistic domains. Temporoparietal cortex, and functional brain networks anchored to this region, are implicated as putative neural substrates of non-linguistic cognitive deficits in logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, suggesting that degeneration of a shared set of brain regions may result in co-occurring linguistic and non-linguistic dysfunction early in the disease course. Here, we provide a Review aimed at broadening the understanding of logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia beyond the lens of an exclusive language disorder. By considering behavioural and neuroimaging research on non-linguistic dysfunction in logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, we propose that a significant portion of multidimensional cognitive features can be explained by degeneration of temporal/inferior parietal cortices and connected regions. Drawing on insights from normative cognitive neuroscience, we propose that these regions underpin a combination of domain-general and domain-selective cognitive processes, whose disruption results in multifaceted cognitive deficits including aphasia. This account explains the common emergence of linguistic and non-linguistic cognitive difficulties in logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, and predicts phenotypic diversification associated with progression of pathology in posterior neocortex.

TI  - Modulation of Brain Activity with Noninvasive Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS): Clinical Applications and Safety Concerns
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a widely-used tool to induce neuroplasticity and modulate cortical function by applying weak direct current over the scalp. In this review, we first introduce the underlying mechanism of action, the brief history from discovery to clinical scientific research, electrode positioning and montages, and parameter setup of tDCS. Then, we review tDCS application in clinical samples including people with drug addiction, major depression disorder, Alzheimer's disease, as well as in children. This review covers the typical characteristics and the underlying neural mechanisms of tDCS treatment in such studies. This is followed by a discussion of safety, especially when the current intensity is increased or the stimulation duration is prolonged. Given such concerns, we provide detailed suggestions regarding safety procedures for tDCS operation. Lastly, future research directions are discussed. They include foci on the development of multi-tech combination with tDCS such as with TMS and fMRI; long-term behavioral and morphological changes; possible applications in other research domains, and more animal research to deepen the understanding of the biological and physiological mechanisms of tDCS stimulation.

TI  - Movement-related event-related desynchronization in neuropsychiatric disorders
T2  - EVENT-RELATED DYNAMICS OF BRAIN OSCILLATIONS
AB  - The analysis of event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) provides information on the dynamics of cortical activation during cognitive and motor tasks and has been applied in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In this chapter, we focus on studies concerning movement-related activity, which showed changes in amount, topography, or time course in relation to not only involvement of the motor system - such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dystonia, and stroke affecting the sensorimotor (SM) pathways - but also physiological aging, degenerative dementia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). In these disorders, the extent of abnormality in the pattern of ERD/ERS is related to the severity of the underlying pathology. Moreover in MS, a correlation with the severity of brain tissue has been found. While there is consistency in changes related to ipokinetic disorders, mainly consisting of delayed appearance of ERD to movement preparation, changes occurring in other brain disorders need to be replicated or raise doubts on the specificity of changes across different diseases. Further studies are needed in order to validate the usefulness of this methodology in the assessment of the single patient for diagnosis and monitoring of the natural course of the disease and of treatment efficacy.

TI  - Predictors and assessment of cognitive dysfunction resulting from ischaemic stroke
T2  - LANCET NEUROLOGY
AB  - Stroke remains a primary cause of morbidity throughout the world mainly because of its effect on cognition. Individuals can recover from physical disability resulting from stroke, but might be unable to return to their previous occupations or independent life because of cognitive impairments. Cognitive dysfunction ranges from focal deficits, resulting directly from an area of infarction or from hypoperfusion in adjacent tissue, to more global cognitive dysfunction. Global dysfunction is likely to be related to other underlying subclinical cerebrovascular disease, such as white-matter disease or subclinical infarcts. Study of cognitive dysfunction after stroke is complicated by varying definitions and lack of measurement of cognition before stroke. Additionally, stroke can affect white-matter connectivity, so newer imaging techniques, such as diffusion-tensor imaging and magnetisation transfer imaging, that can be used to assess this subclinical injury are important tools in the assessment of cognitive dysfunction after stroke. As research is increasingly focused on the role of preventable risk factors in the development of dementia, the role of stroke in the development of cognitive impairment and dementia could be another target for prevention.

TI  - Insights into the Pathophysiology of Psychiatric Symptoms in Central Nervous System Disorders: Implications for Early and Differential Diagnosis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Different psychopathological manifestations, such as affective, psychotic, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and impulse control disturbances, may occur in most central nervous system (CNS) disorders including neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. Psychiatric symptoms often represent the clinical onset of such disorders, thus potentially leading to misdiagnosis, delay in treatment, and a worse outcome. In this review, psychiatric symptoms observed along the course of several neurological diseases, namely Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis, are discussed, as well as the involved brain circuits and molecular/synaptic alterations. Special attention has been paid to the emerging role of fluid biomarkers in early detection of these neurodegenerative diseases. The frequent occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in neurological diseases, even as the first clinical manifestations, should prompt neurologists and psychiatrists to share a common clinico-biological background and a coordinated diagnostic approach.

TI  - Connectomics: A new paradigm for understanding brain disease
T2  - EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
AB  - In recent years, pathophysiological models of brain disorders have shifted from an emphasis on understanding pathology in specific brain regions to characterizing disturbances of interconnected neural systems. This shift has paralleled rapid advances in connectomics, a field concerned with comprehensively mapping the neural elements and inter-connections that constitute the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a central role in these efforts, as it allows relatively cost-effective in vivo assessment of the macro-scale architecture of brain network connectivity. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to some of the basic concepts in the field and review how recent developments in imaging connectomics are yielding new insights into brain disease, with a particular focus on Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Specifically, we consider how research into circuit-level, connectome-wide and topological changes is stimulating the development of new aetiopathological theories and bionnarkers with potential for clinical translation. The findings highlight the advantage of conceptualizing brain disease as a result of disturbances in an interconnected complex system, rather than discrete pathology in isolated sub-sets of brain regions.

TI  - Potential mechanisms underlying the accelerated cognitive decline in people with chronic low back pain: A scoping review
T2  - AGEING RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB  - A growing body of evidence has shown that people with chronic low back pain (CLBP) demonstrate significantly greater declines in multiple cognitive domains than people who do not have CLBP. Given the high prevalence of CLBP in the ever-growing aging population that may be more vulnerable to cognitive decline, it is important to understand the mechanisms underlying the accelerated cognitive decline observed in this population, so that proper preventive or treatment approaches can be developed and implemented. The current scoping review summarizes what is known regarding the potential mechanisms underlying suboptimal cognitive performance and cognitive decline in people with CLBP and discusses future research directions. Five potential mechanisms were identified based on the findings from 34 included studies: (1) altered activity in the cortex and neural networks; (2) grey matter atrophy; (3) microglial activation and neuroinflammation; (4) comorbidities associated with CLBP; and (5) gut microbiota dysbiosis. Future studies should deepen the understanding of mechanisms underlying this association so that proper prevention and treatment strategies can be developed.

TI  - Frontal white matter volume and delta EEG sources negatively correlate in awake subjects with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: A relationship between brain atrophy and delta rhythmicity (1.5-4 Hz) has been previously explored in Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects [Fernandez A, Arrazola J, Maestu F, Amo C, Gil-Gregorio P, Wienbruch C, Ortiz T. Correlations of hippocampal atrophy and focal low-frequency magnetic activity in Alzheimer disease: volumetric MR imaging-magnetoencephalographic study. Am J Neuroradiol. 2003 24(3):481-487]. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that such a relationship does exist not only in AD patients but also across the continuum of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.
   Methods: Resting, eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 34 MCI and 65 AD subjects. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). EEG cortical sources were estimated by LORETA. Cortical EEG sources were correlated with MR-based measurements of lobar brain volume (white and gray matter).
   Results: A negative correlation was observed between the frontal white matter and the amplitude of frontal delta sources (2-4 Hz) across MCI and AD subjects.
   Conclusions: These results confirmed for the first time the hypothesis that the sources of resting delta rhythms (2-4 Hz) are correlated with lobar brain volume across MCI and AD subjects.
   Significance: The present findings support, at least at group level, the 'transition hypothesis' of brain structural and functional continuity between MCI and AD. (c) 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Prevention and treatment of tardive dyskinesia caused by antipsychotic drugs
T2  - ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE
AB  - Introduction. - Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder of tongue, jawbone, trunk and/or limbs that may appear after a prolonged use of dopamine receptor blocking agents (after 3 months of treatment or after 1 month for patients over 60), and that are present during at least four consecutive weeks. TD is a frequent side effect of both classical neuroleptics and new generation antipsychotic drugs. The prevalence of iatrogenic TD is between 24 and 32% after treatment with classical neuroleptics and about 13% after treatment with a new generation antipsychotic.
   Objective. - This paper presents an updated literature review of data on diagnosis, prevention and treatment of TD.
   Methods. - We conducted a review of literature using the Medline Browser tool, screening studies from 1950 to 2013 in English or French with keywords tardive dyskinesia, "tardive dystonia", and "abnormal movements caused by antipsychotic drugs".
   Results. - We first describe and define semeiological features of TD: dystonia, tremor, myoclonus, acathisie, chorea, ballism and athetosia. Secondarily, we resume the main differential diagnoses to exclude when confronted with this kind of movement disorders. Differential diagnoses for dyskinesia can be classified between primary (Parkinson and Huntington diseases) and secondary (Wilson disease, intoxication, metabolic abnormality, cerebrovascular accident) abnormal movements. Psychogenic TD can be evocated if previous pathologies are excluded in case of atypical clinical presentation. We detail the risk factors for TD. Endogenous risk factors are related to the patient's age, underlying psychiatric disease (bipolar disorder or Alzheimer dementia), addiction to alcohol or cocaine, female gender, or neurodevelopmental vulnerability. latrogenic risk factors are high doses of antipsychotics, long or intermittent administration, and particular pharmaceutical classes or associations of antipsychotics. As a comprehensive tool, we review the main physiopathological hypotheses to explain the occurrence of TD in some patients: hypersensitivity of D2 neuronal receptor or neurotoxicity associated with oxidative stress mechanisms. We also summarize the current guidelines for prevention and treatment of TD. Three successive curative strategies are suggested in the literature. First, the clinician can adapt the current anti psychotic treatment (switch to a new generation antipsychotic, diminution or cessation of antipsychotic drugs). If this first intervention is not pertinent or ineffective, the clinician can prescribe an antikinetic therapeutic agent, such as tetrabenazine, or an antioxidant. Review of the published studies does not show proof of efficacy of cholinergic or anticholinergic drugs, benzodiazepine or other GABAergic drugs, nor for amantadine. Non-medication therapeutics such as ECT and TMS are discussed, but the level of proof is insufficient to promote them as a curative treatment for TD. In case of high resistance and discomfort for the patient, a neurosurgical intervention should be discussed. These curative interventions are limited, emphasising the importance of TD prevention, by limiting the prescription and doses of antipsychotics, regularly evaluating their side effects and informing the patient of TD's risk.
   Conclusion. - We propose to practitioners a synthesised update of literature concerning a frequent iatrogenic effect of antipsychotics. Nevertheless, no solid guidelines have as yet been established, and further clinical studies are expected in order to better understand this frequent and discomforting side effect.

TI  - Nonmedication Devices in Development for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE REPORTS
AB  - Huge investments continue to be made in treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), with more than one hundred drugs currently in development. Pharmacological approaches and drug development, particularly those targeting amyloid-beta, have dominated the therapeutic landscape. At the same time, there is also a growing interest in devices for treating AD. This review aimed to identify and describe devices under development for AD treatment. In this review, we queried the devices that are in development for the treatment of AD. PubMed was searched through the end of 2021 using the terms "device," "therapeutics," and "Alzheimer's" for articles that report on devices to treat AD. Ten devices with 31 references were identified as actively being developed for the treatment of AD. Many of these devices are far along in development. Device-based therapies are often overlooked when evaluating treatment approaches to AD. However, many devices for treating AD are in development and some show promising results.

TI  - Depression rating scales in Parkinson's disease: Critique and recommendations
T2  - MOVEMENT DISORDERS
AB  - Depression is a common comorbid condition in Parkinson's disease (PD) and a major contributor to poor quality of life and disability. However, depression can be difficult to assess in patients with PD due to overlapping symptoms and difficulties in the assessment of depression in cognifively impaired patients. As several rating scales have been used to assess depression in PD (dPD), the Movement Disorder Society commissioned a task force to assess their clinimettic properties and make clinical recommendations regarding their use. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the use of depression scales in PD and determine which scales should be selected for this review. The scales reviewed were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Depression Scale (Ham-D), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part 1, Cornell Scale for the Assessment of Depression in Dementia (CSDD), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Seven clinical researchers with clinical and research experience in the assessment of dPD were assigned to review the scales using a structured format. The most appropriate scale is dependent on the clinical or research goal. However, observer-rated scales are preferred if the study or clinical situalion permits. For screening purposes, the HAM-D, BDI, HADS, MADRS, and GDS are valid in dPD. The CES-D and CSDD are alternative instruments that need validation in dPD. For measurement of severity of depressive symptoms, the Ham-D, MADRS, BDI, and SDS scales are recommended. Further studies are needed to validate the CSDD, which could be particularly useful for the assessment of severity of dPD in patients with comorbid dementia. To account for overlapping motor and nonmotor symptoms of depression, adjusted instrument cutoff scores may be needed for dPD, and scales to assess severity of motor symptoms (e.g., UPDRS) should also be included to help adjust for confounding factors. The HADS and the GDS include limited motor symptom assessment and may, therefore, be most useful in rating depression severity across a range of PD severity; however, these scales appear insensitive in severe depression. The complex and time-consuming task of developing a new scale to measure depression specifically for patients with PD is currently not warranted. (c) 2007 Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - During these last 30 years, cognitive rehabilitation has accomplished dramatic improvement. In this paper, we review progress in four main domains: the development of pragmatic and ecological approaches in neuropsychological rehabilitation; the development of computerised rehabilitation; rehabilitation of executive functions; cognitive rehabilitation in degenerative dementia. Finally, we present a single-case study, recently published elsewhere, showing the effectiveness of rehabilitation of verbal working memory in a patient with left hemisphere stroke. In addition, future issues for rehabilitation research are presented. The development of bottom-up rehabilitation strategies as well as the use of inter-hemispheric interactions appears as future promising tracks for clinical rehabilitation.

TI  - Motoneuron firing in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is an inexorably progressive neurodegenerative disorder involving the classical motor system and the frontal effector brain, causing muscular weakness and atrophy, with variable upper motor neuron signs and often an associated fronto-temporal dementia. The physiological disturbance consequent on the motor system degeneration is beginning to be well understood. In this review we describe aspects of the motor cortical, neuronal, and lower motor neuron dysfunction. We show how studies of the changes in the pattern of motor unit firing help delineate the underlying pathophysiological disturbance as the disease progresses. Such studies are beginning to illuminate the underlying disordered pathophysiological processes in the disease, and are important in designing new approaches to therapy and especially for clinical trials.

TI  - The enigma of vascular depression in old age: a critical update
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION
AB  - Depression is common in older individuals and is associated with high disability and increased mortality, yet the factors predicting late-life depression (LLD) are poorly understood. The relationship between of depressive disorder, age- and disease-related processes have generated pathogenic hypotheses and provided new treatment options. LLD syndrome is often related to a variety of vascular mechanisms, in particular hypertension, cerebral small vessel disease, white matter lesions, subcortical vascular impairment, and other processes (e.g., inflammation, neuroimmune regulatory dysmechanisms, neurodegenerative changes, amyloid accumulation) that may represent etiological factors by affecting frontolimbic and other neuronal networks predisposing to depression. The "vascular depression" hypothesis suggests that cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and vascular risk factors may predispose, induce or perpetuate geriatric depressive disorders. It is based on the presence of various cerebrovascular risk factors in many patients with LLD, its co-morbidity with cerebrovascular lesions, and the frequent development of depression after stroke. Other findings related to vascular depression are atrophy of the medial temporal cortex or generalized cortical atrophy that are usually associated with cognitive impairment. Other pathogenetic hypotheses of LLD, such as metabolic or inflammatory ones, are briefly discussed. Treatment planning should consider there may be a modest response to antidepressants, but several evidence-based and novel treatment options for LLD exist, such as electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, neurobiology-based psychotherapy, as well as antihypertension and antiinflammatory drugs. However, their effectiveness needs further investigation, and new methodologies for prevention and treatment of depression in older individuals should be developed.

TI  - Freezing of gait: Promising avenues for future treatment
T2  - PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS
AB  - Freezing of gait is a devastating symptom of Parkinson's disease and other forms of parkinsonism. It poses a major burden on both patients and their families, as freezing often leads to falls, fall-related injuries and a loss of independence. Treating freezing of gait is difficult for a variety of reasons: it has a paroxysmal and unpredictable nature; a multifaceted pathophysiology, with an interplay between motor elements (disturbed stepping mechanisms) and non-motor elements (cognitive decline, anxiety); and a complex (and likely heterogeneous) underlying neural substrate, involving multiple failing neural networks. In recent years, advances in translational neuroscience have offered new insights into the pathophysiology underlying freezing. Furthermore, the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of available treatments (or lack thereof) are better understood. Driven by these concepts, researchers and clinicians have begun to improve currently available treatment options, and develop new and better treatment methods. Here, we evaluate the range of pharmacological (i.e. closed-looped approaches), surgical (i.e. multi-target and adaptive deep brain and spinal cord stimulation) and behavioural (i.e. biofeedback and cueing on demand) treatment options that are under development, and propose novel avenues that are likely to play a crucial role in the clinical management of freezing of gait in the near future. The outcomes of this review suggest that the successful future management of freezing of gait will require individualized treatments that can be implemented in an on-demand manner in response to imminent freezing. With this review we hope to guide much-needed advances in treating this devastating symptom of Parkinson's disease. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Catechol-O-methyltransferase, Cognition and Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH
AB  - Objective: Cognition is a complex trait representing a set of all mental abilities and processes related to knowledge. Although diverse brain regions are involved, most cognitive processes appear to engage cortical regions. The activity of dopaminergic neurons in prefrontal cortex represents a biological substrate underlying cognitive functions. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most frequent dementia associated with cognitive impairments. Cognitive impairment in AD starts slowly with discrete deterioration in memory, language, thinking and reasoning, but it progresses into more severe and debilitating cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive function is affected by the complex interactions between various genetic, epigenetic, developmental and environmental factors. One of the most studied genes, associated with cognitive disturbances, is the gene coding for Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), the enzyme with major role in dopamine metabolism and modulation of different brain functions. Therefore, COMT is studied as a target for many neuropsychiatric disorders, including dementias and AD. The COMT Val158/108Met functional polymorphism affects significantly the enzyme activity and consequently cognitive performance associated with altered dopamine function. The association of COMT Val158/108Met polymorphism with some cognitive domains and psychosis in AD was reported in some but not in all studies. Besides COMT Val158/108Met polymorphism, other risk genotypes or haplotypes should be evaluated to determine the association of COMT with cognitive decline in AD.
   Conclusion: Better understanding of the role of COMT in cognitive processes in AD, as well as integration of neurobiological, genetic, genomic and epigenetic data, might help in developing new potential therapies of cognitive impairments and psychotic symptoms, characteristic features of AD.

TI  - Word retrieval therapies in primary progressive aphasia
T2  - APHASIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) with its three variants is a progressive neurodegenerative dementia in which language impairment is the first and most dominant symptom. Traditionally, speech-language pathologists who deliver therapy to adults with acquired neurogenic language disorders shy away from treatment of progressive aphasia as there is no promise of lasting effects and only limited data regarding treatment efficacy.
   Aims: This paper comprises the most current review of the literature focused on treatment of naming impairments in PPA, and aims to encourage and assist clinicians in selecting intervention approaches for individuals with PPA. It highlights current trends and challenges in delivering successful therapy for naming deficits in PPA.
   Main Contribution: We reviewed papers that reported different forms of naming therapy for patients with PPA, which included interventions that, although not always aimed directly at anomic deficits, brought about improvement in naming. Immediate gains, maintenance, and generalisation effects are summarised, along with a variety of approaches and methodologies that can be applied to the PPA population. We also provide a list of factors that were found to contribute to the success of therapy and to the maintenance and/or generalisation of treatment gains.
   Conclusions: Current literature delivers encouraging evidence for clinicians wanting to provide naming therapy to patients with PPA. Although PPA is a progressive disorder, both the immediate treatment effects and, in many cases, maintenance results show that improvements are possible. The issues of generalisation of naming gains beyond the clinician's office still require more studies to determine the best conditions, designs, and patient suitability.

TI  - A 12-month randomised pilot trial of the Alzheimer's and music therapy study: a feasibility assessment of music therapy and physical activity in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease
T2  - PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES
AB  - Background The Alzheimer's and Music Therapy (ALMUTH) study is the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) design with 12 months of active non-pharmacological therapy (NPT) implementing music therapy (MT) and physical activity (PA) for participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present article is to retrospectively examine the inclusion of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease patients into the main ALMUTH study protocol and to determine if continued inclusion of AD patients is warranted.Methods The randomised pilot trial was conducted as a parallel three-arm RCT, reflecting the experimental design of the ALMUTH study. The trial was conducted in Bergen, Norway, and randomisation (1:1:1) was performed by an external researcher. The study was open label and the experimental design features two active NPTs: MT and PA, and a passive control (no intervention, CON) in Norwegian speaking patients with AD who still live at home and could provide informed consent. Sessions were offered once per week (up to 90 min) up to 40 sessions over 12 months. Baseline and follow-up tests included a full neuropsychological test battery and three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements (structural, functional, and diffusion weighted imaging). Feasibility outcomes were assessed and were determined as feasible if they met the target criteria.Results Eighteen participants with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate AD were screened, randomised, and tested once at baseline and once after 12-months. Participants were divided into three groups: MT (n = 6), PA (n = 6), and CON (n = 6). Results of the study revealed that the ALMUTH protocol in patients with AD was not feasible. The adherence to the study protocol was poor (50% attended sessions), with attrition and retention rates at 50%. The recruitment was costly and there were difficulties acquiring participants who met the inclusion criteria. Issues with study fidelity and problems raised by staff were taken into consideration for the updated study protocol. No adverse events were reported by the patients or their caregivers.Conclusions The pilot trial was not deemed feasible in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. To mitigate this, the ALMUTH study has expanded the recruitment criteria to include participants with milder forms of memory impairment (pre-AD) in addition to expanding the neuropsychological test battery. The ALMUTH study is currently ongoing through 2023.

TI  - Functional Neuroimaging in Psychiatry-Aiding in Diagnosis and Guiding Treatment. What the American Psychiatric Association Does Not Know
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - While early efforts in psychiatry were focused on uncovering the neurobiological basis of psychiatric symptoms, they made little progress due to limited ability to observe the living brain. Today, we know a great deal about the workings of the brain; yet, none of this neurobiological awareness has translated into the practice of psychiatry. The categorical system which dominates psychiatric diagnosis and thinking fails to match up to the real world of genetics, sophisticated psychological testing, and neuroimaging. Nevertheless, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) recently published a position paper stating that neuroimaging provided no benefit to the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Using the diagnosis of depression as a model, we illustrate how setting aside the unrealistic expectation of a pathognomonic "fingerprint" for categorical diagnoses, we can avoid missing the biological and, therefore, treatable contributors to psychopathology which can and are visualized using functional neuroimaging. Infection, toxicity, inflammation, gut-brain dysregulation, and traumatic brain injury can all induce psychiatric manifestations which masquerade as depression and other psychiatric disorders. We review these and provide illustrative clinical examples. We further describe situations for which single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) functional neuroimaging already meet or exceed the criteria set forth by the APA to define a neuroimaging biomarker, including the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, the differential diagnosis of ADHD, and the evaluation of traumatic brain injury. The limitations, both real and perceived, of SPECT and PET functional neuroimaging in the field of psychiatry are also elaborated. An important overarching concept for diagnostic imaging in all its forms, including functional neuroimaging, is that imaging allows a clinician to eliminate possibilities, narrow the differential diagnosis, and tailor the treatment plan. This progression is central to any medical diagnostic process.

TI  - Microstates in resting-state EEG: Current status and future directions
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is a powerful method of studying the electrophysiology of the brain with high temporal resolution. Several analytical approaches to extract information from the EEG signal have been proposed. One method, termed microstate analysis, considers the multichannel EEG recording as a series of quasi-stable "microstates" that are each characterized by a unique topography of electric potentials over the entire channel array. Because this technique simultaneously considers signals recorded from all areas of the cortex, it is capable of assessing the function of large-scale brain networks whose disruption is associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we first introduce the method of EEG microstate analysis. We then review studies that have discovered significant changes in the resting-state microstate series in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and behavioral states. We discuss the potential utility of this method in detecting neurophysiological impairments in disease and monitoring neurophysiological changes in response to an intervention. Finally, we discuss how the resting-state microstate series may reflect rapid switching among neural networks while the brain is at rest, which could represent activity of resting-state networks described by other neuroimaging modalities. We conclude by commenting on the current and future status of microstate analysis, and suggest that EEG microstates represent a promising neurophysiological tool for understanding and assessing brain network dynamics on a millisecond timescale in health and disease.

TI  - Brain neural synchronization and functional coupling in Alzheimer's disease as revealed by resting state EEG rhythms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative disorder, typically causing dementia along aging. AD is mainly characterized by a pathological extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides that affects excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, inducing aberrant patterns in neuronal circuits. Growing evidence shows that AD targets cortical neuronal networks related to cognitive functions including episodic memory and visuospatial attention. This is partially reflected by the abnormal mechanisms of cortical neural synchronization and coupling that generate resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms. The cortical neural synchronization is typically indexed by EEG power density. The EEG coupling between electrode pairs probes functional (inter-relatedness of EEG signals) and effective (casual effect from one over the other electrode) connectivity. The former is typically indexed by synchronization likelihood (linear and nonlinear) or spectral coherence (linear), the latter by granger causality or information theory indexes. Here we reviewed literature concerning EEG studies in condition of resting state in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects as a window on abnormalities of the cortical neural synchronization and functional and effective connectivity. Results showed abnormalities of the EEG power density at specific frequency bands (<12 Hz) in the MCI and AD populations, associated with an altered functional and effective EEG connectivity among long range cortical networks (i.e. fronto-parietal and fronto-temporal). These results suggest that resting state EEG rhythms reflect the abnormal cortical neural synchronization and coupling in the brain of prodromal and overt AD subjects, possibly reflecting dysfunctional neuroplasticity of the neural transmission in long range cortical networks.

TI  - Altered Neural Networks in the Papez Circuit: Implications for Cognitive Dysfunction after Cerebral Ischemia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Cerebral ischemia remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Although the incidence of death has decreased over the years, surviving patients may suffer from long-term cognitive impairments and have an increased risk for dementia. Unfortunately, research aimed toward developing therapies that can improve cognitive outcomes following cerebral ischemia has proved difficult given the fact that little is known about the underlying processes involved. Nevertheless, mechanisms that disrupt neural network activity may provide valuable insight, since disturbances in both local and global networks in the brain have been associated with deficits in cognition. In this review, we suggest that abnormal neural dynamics within different brain networks may arise from disruptions in synaptic plasticity processes and circuitry after ischemia. This discussion primarily concerns disruptions in local network activity within the hippocampus and other extra-hippocampal components of the Papez circuit, given their role in memory processing. However, impaired synaptic plasticity processes and disruptions in structural and functional connections within the Papez circuit have important implications for alterations within the global network, as well. Although much work is required to establish this relationship, evidence thus far suggests there is a link. If pursued further, findings may lead toward a better understanding of how deficits in cognition arise, not only in cerebral ischemia, but in other neurological diseases as well.

TI  - Naming ability changes in physiological and pathological aging
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Over the last two decades, age-related anatomical and functional brain changes have been characterized by evidence acquired primarily by means of non-invasive functional neuroimaging. These functional changes are believed to favor positive reorganization driven by adaptations to system changes as compensation for cognitive decline. These functional modifications have been linked to residual brain plasticity mechanisms, suggesting that all areas of the brain remain plastic during physiological and pathological aging. A technique that can be used to investigate changes in physiological and pathological aging is non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). The present paper reviews studies that have applied NIBS in younger and older adults and in patients with dementia to track changes in the cerebral areas involved in a language task (naming). The results of this research suggest that the left frontal and temporal areas are crucial during naming. Moreover, it is suggested that in older adults and patients with dementia, the right prefrontal cortex is also engaged during naming tasks, and naming performance correlates with age and/or the degree of the pathological process. Potential theories underlying the bilateral involvement of the prefrontal cortex are discussed, and the relationship between the bilateral engagement of the prefrontal cortex and the age or degree of pathology is explored.

TI  - Involvement of calpain in the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease
T2  - MEDICINAL RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common (60% to 80%) age-related disease associated with dementia and is characterized by a deterioration of behavioral and cognitive capacities leading to death in few years after diagnosis, mainly due to complications from chronic illness. The characteristic hallmarks of the disease are extracellular senile plaques (SPs) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) with neuropil threads, which are a direct result of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing to A beta, and tau hyperphosphorylation. However, many indirect underlying processes play a role in this event. One of these underlying mechanisms leading to these histological hallmarks is the uncontrolled hyperactivation of a family of cysteine proteases called calpains. Under normal physiological condition calpains participate in many processes of cells' life and their activation is tightly controlled. However, with an increase in age, increased oxidative stress and other excitotoxicity assaults, this regulatory system becomes impaired and result in increased activation of these proteases involving them in the pathogenesis of various diseases including neurodegeneration like AD. Reviewed here is a pool of data on the implication of calpains in the pathogenesis of AD, the underlying molecular mechanism, and the potential of targeting these enzymes for AD therapeutics.

TI  - Apathy in Parkinson's Disease: Clinical Patterns and Neurobiological Basis
T2  - CELLS
AB  - Apathy is commonly defined as a loss of motivation leading to a reduction in goal-directed behaviors. This multidimensional syndrome, which includes cognitive, emotional and behavioral components, is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric features of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been established that the prevalence of apathy increases as PD progresses. However, the pathophysiology and anatomic substrate of this syndrome remain unclear. Apathy seems to be underpinned by impaired anatomical structures that link the prefrontal cortex with the limbic system. It can be encountered in the prodromal stage of the disease and in fluctuating PD patients receiving bilateral chronic subthalamic nucleus stimulation. In these stages, apathy may be considered as a disorder of motivation that embodies amotivational behavioral syndrome, is underpinned by combined dopaminergic and serotonergic denervation and is dopa-responsive. In contrast, in advanced PD patients, apathy may be considered as cognitive apathy that announces cognitive decline and PD dementia, is underpinned by diffuse neurotransmitter system dysfunction and Lewy pathology spreading and is no longer dopa-responsive. In this review, we discuss the clinical patterns of apathy and their treatment, the neurobiological basis of apathy, the potential role of the anatomical structures involved and the pathways in motivational and cognitive apathy.

TI  - [<SUP>11</SUP>C]-WAY100635 PET demonstrates marked 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor changes in sporadic ALS
T2  - BRAIN
AB  - The pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains obscure, but it is now clear that neuronal loss is not confined to the motor cortex, even in cases without dementia. A reliable method of assessing cortical involvement in vivo remains elusive. WAY100635 binds selectively to the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A) receptor, which is expressed on pyramidal neurones present throughout the cortex. [C-11]-WAY100635 PET is, therefore, a potential marker of cerebral neuronal loss or dysfunction in ALS. Twenty-one ALS subjects and 19 healthy volunteers underwent [C-11]-WAY100635 PET of the brain. A cortical template consisting of multiple volumes of interest (VOI) was applied to each individual's [C-11]-WAY100635 binding potential (BP) image to determine the regional reduction in binding in ALS patients compared to controls. There was a marked reduction (21%) in both the global cortical and raphe BP of [C-11]-WAY100635 in ALS patients (P < 0.001), with regional variations in the VOI analysis that ranged from 16% to 29% decrease compared with the control group, and trends to greater reductions in those with bulbar involvement. To clarify the significance of the global cortical reductions, statistical parametric mapping was used as an alternative method to identify the cortical regions with the most significant decreases in [C-11]-WAY100635 binding. SPM analysis revealed the greatest differences between ALS cases and controls in frontotemporal regions, cingulate and lateral precentral gyri. The reductions in cortical [C-11]-WAY100635 binding were not related to depression, riluzole or other drug use. We postulate that the reduction of 5-HT1A binding represents loss of, or damage to, neurones bearing these receptors although we cannot exclude the possibility that these reductions reflect alterations in receptor expression or function. Further investigation into the role of the 5-HT1A receptor and the potential of [C-11]-WAY100635 PET as a marker of cortical dysfunction in ALS is warranted.

TI  - Incisionless MR-guided focused ultrasound: technical considerations and current therapeutic approaches in psychiatric disorders
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - Introduction MR-guided focused ultrasound operating at higher intensities have been reported to effectively and precisely ablate deeper brain structures like the basal ganglia or the thalamic nuclei for the treatment of refractory movement disorders, neuropathic pain and most recently neuropsychiatric disorders, while low-intensity focused ultrasound represents an approach promoting mechanical blood-brain-barrier opening and neuromodulation. This narrative review summarizes the technical development and the therapeutic potential of incisionless MRgFUS in order to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. Areas covered A narrative review of clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of MRgFUS. A literature review was performed using the following search terms: MR-guided focused ultrasound, psychiatric disorders, noninvasive and invasive brain modulation/stimulation techniques. Expert opinion MRgFUS ablation is under clinical investigation (unblinded study design) for obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCDs) [capsulotomy; ALIC] and depression/anxiety disorders [capsulotomy] and has demonstrated an improvement in OCD and depression, although of preliminary character. Low-intensity ultrasound applications have been explored in Alzheimer ' s disease (phase 1 study) and healthy subjects. Currently, limited evidence hinders comparison and selection between MRgFUS and noninvasive/invasive brain modulation therapies. However, comparative, sham-controlled trials are needed to reexamine the preliminary findings for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Mechanisms and treatment of late-life depression
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Depression predisposes to medical illnesses and advances biological aging indicated by shorter telomere length, accelerated brain aging and advanced epigenetic aging. Medical illnesses also increase the risk of late-life depression. The reciprocal relationships of depression with aging-related and disease-related processes have generated pathogenetic hypotheses and provided treatment targets. Targeting risk factors of vascular disease in mid-life is a logical approach in prevention of vascular depression. The depression-executive dysfunction and the vascular depression syndromes have clinical presentations and neuroimaging findings consistent with frontostriatal abnormalities. Dopamine D-2/3 agonists are effective in depression of Parkinson's disease and their efficacy needs to be assessed in these two syndromes. Computerized cognitive remediation targeting functions of the cognitive control network may improve both executive functions and depressive symptoms of late-life major depression. Significant progress has been made in neurostimulation treatments in depressed younger adults. TMS targeting deep structures responsible for mood regulation is well tolerated by older adults and its efficacy in syndromes of late-life depression needs to be studied. Efficacious psychotherapies for late-life depression exist, but are underutilized in part because of their complexity. Streamlined, stepped psychotherapies targeting behaviors assumed to result from dysfunction of brain networks implicated in late-life depression can be easy to learn and have potential for dissemination. However, their effectiveness needs further investigation. Depression increases the risk of dementing disorders. Antidepressants are rather ineffective in treating depression of demented patients, but long-term use of antidepressants may reduce the risk of dementia. However, confirmation studies are needed.

TI  - Gamma Oscillations in Alzheimer's Disease and Their Potential Therapeutic Role
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Despite decades of research, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains a lethal neurodegenerative disorder for which there are no effective treatments. This review examines the latest evidence of a novel and newly introduced perspective, which focuses on the restoration of gamma oscillations and investigates their potential role in the treatment of AD. Gamma brain activity (similar to 25-100 Hz) has been well-known for its role in cognitive function, including memory, and it is fundamental for healthy brain activity and intra-brain communication. Aberrant gamma oscillations have been observed in both mice AD models and human AD patients. A recent line of work demonstrated that gamma entrainment, through auditory and visual sensory stimulation, can effectively attenuate AD pathology and improve cognitive function in mice models of the disease. The first evidence from AD patients indicate that gamma entrainment therapy can reduce loss of functional connectivity and brain atrophy, improve cognitive function, and ameliorate several pathological markers of the disease. Even though research is still in its infancy, evidence suggests that gamma-based therapy may have a disease-modifying effect and has signified a new and promising era in AD research.

TI  - Brain Connectivity and Graph Theory Analysis in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease: The Contribution of Electrophysiological Techniques
T2  - BRAIN SCIENCES
AB  - In recent years, applications of the network science to electrophysiological data have increased as electrophysiological techniques are not only relatively low cost, largely available on the territory and non-invasive, but also potential tools for large population screening. One of the emergent methods for the study of functional connectivity in electrophysiological recordings is graph theory: it allows to describe the brain through a mathematic model, the graph, and provides a simple representation of a complex system. As Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are associated with synaptic disruptions and changes in the strength of functional connectivity, they can be well described by functional connectivity analysis computed via graph theory. The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of the most recent applications of the graph theory to electrophysiological data in the two by far most frequent neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

TI  - A brief essay on non-pharmacological treatment of Alzheimer's disease
T2  - REVIEWS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES
AB  - Current pharmacological therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) do not modify its course and are not always beneficial. Therefore, the optimization of quality of life represents the best possible outcome achievable in all stages of the disease. Cognitive and behavioural rehabilitation represents the main therapeutic approach for this purpose, also in order to mitigate indirectly the burden of distress of family caregivers. The aim of this mini-review is to go through this theme by discussing cognitive activation, virtual reality and neuromodulation techniques. The practices summarized in this essay are not alternative but, often, complementary therapies to standardized pharmacological treatment. The present mini-review has found encouraging results but also the need for more conclusive evidence for all types of non-invasive/non-pharmacological treatment of AD.

TI  - Treatment for cognitive and neuropsychiatric non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease: current evidence and future perspectives
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF NEUROTHERAPEUTICS
AB  - IntroductionNon-motor symptoms (NMS) affect patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) from the prodromal to the advanced stages. NMS phenotypes greatly vary and have a huge impact on patients' and caregivers' quality of life (QoL). The management of cognitive and neuropsychiatric NMS remains an unmet need.Areas coveredThe authors, herein, review the dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic pathogenesis, clinical features, assessment, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of cognitive and neuropsychiatric NMS in PD. They discuss the current evidence and report the findings of an overview of ongoing trials on pharmacological and selected non-pharmacological strategies.Expert opinionThe treatment of cognitive and neuropsychiatric NMS in PD is poorly explored, and therapeutic options are unsatisfactory. Pharmacological treatment of cognitive NMS is based on symptomatic active principles used in Alzheimer's disease. Dopamine agonists, selective serotonin, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have some evidence on PD-related depression. Clozapine, quetiapine, and pimavanserin may be considered for psychosis in PD. Evidence on the treatment of other neuropsychiatric NMS is limited or lacking. Addressing pathophysiological and clinical issues, which hamper solid evidence on the treatment of cognitive and neuropsychiatric NMS, may reduce the impact on QoL for PD patients and their caregivers.

TI  - The neurobiology of depression in later-life: Clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging and pathophysiological features
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - As the population ages, the economic and societal impacts of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders are expected to rise sharply. Like dementia, late-life depressive disorders are common and are linked to increased disability, high healthcare utilisation, cognitive decline and premature mortality. Considerable heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of major depression across the life cycle may reflect unique pathophysiological pathways to illness; differentiating those with earlier onset who have grown older (early-onset depression), from those with illness onset after the age of 50 or 60 years (late-onset depression). The last two decades have witnessed significant advances in our understanding of the neurobiology of early- and late-onset depression, and has shown that disturbances of fronto-subcortical functioning are implicated. New biomedical models extend well beyond perturbations of traditional monoamine systems to include altered neurotrophins, endocrinologic and immunologic system dysfunction, inflammatory processes and gene expression alterations. This more recent research has highlighted that a range of illness-specific, neurodegenerative and vascular factors appear to contribute to the various phenotypic presentations. This review highlights the major features of late-life depression, with specific reference to its associated aetiological, clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, neuropathological, inflammatory and genetic correlates. Data examining the efficacy of pharmacological, nonpharmacological and novel treatments for depression are discussed. Ultimately, future research must aim to evaluate whether basic biomedical knowledge can be successfully translated into enhanced health outcomes via the implementation of early intervention paradigms.

TI  - Circular RNAs in Alzheimer's Disease: A New Perspective of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Targets
T2  - CNS & NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS-DRUG TARGETS
AB  - Background Circular RNAs (circRNAs), as covalently closed single-stranded noncoding RNA molecules, have been recently identified to involve in several biological processes, principally through targeting microRNAs. Among various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), accumulating evidence has proposed key roles for circRNAs in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); although the exact relationship between these RNA molecules and AD progression is not clear, they have been believed to mostly act as miRNA sponges or gene transcription modulators through the correlating with multiple proteins, involved in the accumulation of Amyloid & beta; (A & beta;) peptides, as well as tau protein, as AD's pathological hallmark. More interestingly, circRNAs have also been reported to play diagnostic and therapeutic roles during the AD progression. Objective The literature review indicated that circRNAs could essentially contribute to the onset and development of AD. Thus, in the current review, the circRNAs' biogenesis and functions are addressed at first, and then the interplay between particular circRNAs and AD is comprehensively discussed. Eventually, the diagnostic and therapeutic significance of these noncoding RNAs is briefly highlighted. Results A large number of circRNAs are expressed in the brain. Thereby, these RNA molecules are noticed as potential regulators of neural functions in healthy circumstances, as well as in neurological disorders. Moreover, circRNAs have also been reported to have potential diagnostic and therapeutic capacities in relation to AD, the most prevalent ND. Conclusion CircRNAs have been shown to act as sponges for miRNAs, thereby regulating the function of related miRNAs, including oxidative stress, reduction of neuroinflammation, and the formation and metabolism of A & beta;, all of which developed in AD. CircRNAs have also been proposed as biomarkers that have potential diagnostic capacities in AD. Despite these characteristics, the use of circRNAs as therapeutic targets and promising diagnostic biomarkers will require further investigation and characterization of the function of these RNA molecules in AD.

TI  - Neurobiological correlates of illness progression in the recurrent affective disorders
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH
AB  - Some clinical aspects of affective illness progression, such as episode-, stress-, and substance-induced sensitization, have been well documented in the literature, but others have received less attention. These include cognitive deficits, treatment-refractoriness, and neurobiological correlates of illness progression, which are the primary focus of this paper. We review the evidence that cognitive dysfunction, treatment resistance, medical comorbidities, and neurobiological abnormalities increase as a function of the number of prior episodes or duration of illness in the recurrent unipolar and bipolar disorders. Substantial evidence supports the view that cognitive dysfunction and vulnerability to a diagnosis of dementia in old age increases as a function of number of prior mood episodes as does non-response to many therapeutic interventions as well as naturalistic treatment. Neurobiological abnormalities that correlate with the number of mood episodes or duration of illness include: anatomical, functional, and biochemical deficits in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as well as amygdala hyperactivity and cortisol hyper-secretion. Some neurotrophic factors and inflammatory markers may also change with greater illness burden. Causality cannot be inferred from these correlative relationships. Nonetheless, given the potentially grave consequences of episode recurrence and progression for morbidity and treatment non-responsiveness, it is clinically wise to assume episodes are causing some of the progressive cognitive and neurobiological abnormalities. As such, earlier and more sustained long-term prophylaxis to attempt to reduce these adverse outcomes is indicated. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Retinal changes in patients with major depressive disorder - A controlled optical coherence tomography study
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Background: Recent studies on the pathophysiology of major depression (MD) indicate that degenerative and inflammatory processes may play a role. This finding is supported by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based meta-analysis that show volume reductions in circumscribed areas of the brain in patients with MD. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), retinal changes have been demonstrated in neurodegenerative disorders. In light of this inflammatory/degenerative hypothesis, we tested whether patients with MD exhibit retinal alterations that might correlate with the severity and duration of the disease.
   Methods: Patients with MD and age-and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited for the measurement of the total volume and thickness of their retina as well as the thicknesses and volumes of five different retinal layers using single-layer-analysis provided by the spectral-domain-OCT.
   Results: OCT data from 28 patients with MD and 20 healthy controls were available for evaluation. The exploratory intra-individual group comparison of the two eyes showed a small but significant difference in the retinal total volume (right = 8.69 mm(3); left = 8.72 mm(3); p = 0.03) only in patients with MD. There were no other significant differences between the patients with MD and the healthy controls with respect to the OCT measurements.
   Limitations: The small group size as well as the absence of correction for multiple testing due to the exploratory design should be considered as limitations of our study.
   Conclusion: While retinal total volume differs between the eyes of patients with MD, the comparison of retinal parameters between these patients and age-and gender-matched healthy volunteers did not show any differences.

TI  - Positive Clinical Neuroscience: Explorations in Positive Neurology
T2  - NEUROSCIENTIST
AB  - Disorders of the brain and its sensory organs have traditionally been associated with deficits in movement, perception, cognition, emotion, and behavior. It is increasingly evident, however, that positive phenomena may also occur in such conditions, with implications for the individual, science, medicine, and for society. This article provides a selective review of such positive phenomena - enhanced function after brain lesions, better-than-normal performance in people with sensory loss, creativity associated with neurological disease, and enhanced performance associated with aging. We propose that, akin to the well-established field of positive psychology and the emerging field of positive clinical psychology, the nascent fields of positive neurology and positive neuropsychology offer new avenues to understand brain-behavior relationships, with both theoretical and therapeutic implications.

TI  - Therapy for Alzheimer's disease: Missing targets and functional markers?
T2  - AGEING RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB  - The development of the next generation therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a huge challenge given the number of promising treatment candidates that failed in trials, despite recent advancements in understanding of genetic, pathophysiologic and clinical characteristics of the disease. This review reflects some of the most current concepts and controversies in developing disease-modifying and new symptomatic treatments. It elaborates on recent changes in the AD research strategy for broadening drug targets, and potentials of emerging nonpharmacological treatment interventions. Established and novel biomarkers are discussed, including emerging cerebrospinal fluid and plasma biomarkers reflecting tau pathology, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. These fluid biomarkers together with neuroimaging findings can provide innovative objective assessments of subtle changes in brain reflecting disease progression. A particular emphasis is given to neurophysiological biomarkers which are well-suited for evaluating the brain overall neural network integrity and function. Combination of multiple biomarkers, including target engagement and outcome biomarkers will empower translational studies and facilitate successful development of effective therapies.

TI  - Graded specialization within and between the anterior temporal lobes
T2  - YEAR IN COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Considerable evidence from different methodologies has identified the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) as key regions for the representation of semantic knowledge. Research interest is now shifting to investigate the roles of different ATL subregions in semantic representation, with particular emphasis on the functions of the left versus right ATLs. In this review, we provide evidence for graded specializations both between and within the ATLs. We argue (1) that multimodal, pan-category semantic representations are supported jointly by both left and right ATLs, yet (2) that the ATLs are not homogeneous in their function. Instead, subtle functional gradations both between and within the ATLs emerge as a consequence of differential connectivity with primary sensory/motor/limbic regions. This graded specialization account of semantic representation provides a compromise between theories that posit no differences between the functions of the left and right ATLs and those that posit that the left and right ATLs are entirely segregated in function. Evidence for this graded account comes from converging sources, and its benefits have been exemplified in formal computational models. We propose that this graded principle is not only a defining feature of the ATLs but is also a more general neurocomputational principle found throughout the temporal lobes.

TI  - Neurorestorative strategies for Alzheimer's disease
T2  - NEUROLOGY INDIA
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that cause devastating cognitive and memory deficits. AD is known to be associated with neuronal death and synaptic loss. Thus, methods to retard the progression of the disease and to promote neuro-regeneration are vital for the prevention of advancement of AD. The recent trend is to decipher the molecular mechanisms of AD, and further aim at neuro-restorative mechanisms such as neuro-protection, neuro-modulation, and neuro-regeneration. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent studies describing various neuro-restorative strategies for AD and mainly focus on stem cell and neuro-modulation therapies. Furthermore, we briefly refer to the other neurorestorative treatments including medications, bioengineering, and gene therapies for AD. Although most of them remain in an experimental phase, neuro-restorative strategies may have the potential for clinical use in the management of this debilitative disease.

TI  - Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and Alzheimer's Disease: From Preclinical to Clinical Evidence of a Strong Association
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE REPORTS
AB  - Increasing evidence coming from both experimental and humans' studies strongly suggest the existence of a link between epilepsy, in particular temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD are more prone to have seizures, and seizures seem to facilitate amyloid-beta and tau deposits, thus promoting neurodegenerative processes. Consistent with this view, long-lasting drug-resistant TLE and AD have been shown to share several pathological and neuroimaging features. Even if studies addressing prevalence of interictal and subclinical epileptiform activity in these patients are not yet conclusive, their findings raise the possibility that epileptiform activity might negatively impact memory and hasten cognitive decline, either directly or by association with unrecognized silent seizures. In addition, data about detrimental effect of network hyperexcitability in temporal regions in the premorbid and early stages of AD open up new therapeutic opportunities for antiseizure medications and/or antiepileptic strategies that might complement or enhance existing therapies, and potentially modify disease progression. Here we provide a review of evidence linking epileptiform activity, network hyperexcitability, and AD, and their role promoting and accelerating neurodegenerative process. Finally, the effects of antiseizure medications on cognition and their optimal administration in patients with AD are summarized.

TI  - Functional Neurophysiological Biomarkers of Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease: A Perspective of Network Hyperexcitability in Disease Progression
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Network hyperexcitability (NH) has recently been suggested as a potential neurophysiological indicator of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as new, more accurate biomarkers of AD are sought. NH has generated interest as a potential indicator of certain stages in the disease trajectory and even as a disease mechanism by which network dysfunction could be modulated. NH has been demonstrated in several animal models of AD pathology and multiple lines of evidence point to the existence of NH in patients with AD, strongly supporting the physiological and clinical relevance of this readout. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the prevalence of NH in animal models through neurophysiological, biochemical, and imaging techniques. However, some of these hypotheses have been built on animal models with limitations and caveats that may have derived NH through other mechanisms or mechanisms without translational validity to sporadic AD patients, potentially leading to an erroneous conclusion of the underlying cause of NH occurring in patients with AD. In this review, we discuss the substantiation for NH in animal models of AD pathology and in human patients, as well as some of the hypotheses considering recently developed animal models that challenge existing hypotheses and mechanisms of NH. In addition, we provide a preclinical perspective on how the development of animal models incorporating AD-specific NH could provide physiologically relevant translational experimental data that may potentially aid the discovery and development of novel therapies for AD.

TI  - Towards Combinatorial Approaches for Preserving Cognitive Fitness in Aging
T2  - TRENDS IN NEUROSCIENCES
AB  - Aging-related cognitive decline represents a critical risk factor for the development of dementia and is associated with global neurophysiological changes. It is imperative to act early, while the neural reserve is still sufficient, to prevent or postpone cognitive decline. Given that no significant modifying pharmacological intervention is available, a focus on pharmacological agents alone seems insufficient. We argue that combinations of different approaches are most effective in stimulating long-lasting molecular changes that restore, promote, and preserve cognition through the modulation of cognitively relevant neurotransmitter systems that ultimately converge in driving neurotrophic signaling. Considering recent technological advances, several interventions apart from cognitive enhancing drugs, including noninvasive brain stimulation, physical exercise/vascular interventions, and cognitive training, seem well positioned to possibly prolong optimal brain functioning upon aging.

TI  - A specific pattern of gray matter atrophy in Alzheimer's disease with depression
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
AB  - Considering the high incidence of depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we conducted a large-sample study to investigate the pattern of gray matter (GM) abnormalities that differentiates depressive from non-depressive AD patients. We included 201 AD patients who underwent MRI assessment and categorized them into depressive and non-depressive subgroups based on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; cut-off score: <= 9). We performed whole-brain voxel-based morphometry analysis in 173 patients after MRI quality control and used between-group comparisons and regression analysis models to analyze the volumetric data controlling for nuisance variables. Depressive AD patients had extensive GM volume loss mainly in the paracentral region, specifically in post- and pre-central gyrus, supplementary motor areas and thalamus compared to non-depressive patients. Similar findings were obtained for the group of 173 patients using regression analysis and GDS score as predictor variable. We provided the first clear demonstration of a unique pattern of GM atrophy that characterizes AD patients with depression which is consistent with regions implicated in the phenomenon of psychomotor retardation that characterizes depression.

These AD-related manifestations result from the alteration of neural circuitry by aggregated forms of amyloid-beta (A beta) and hyperphosphorylated tau, which are neurotoxic. From a neuroscience perspective, identifying neural circuits that integrate various inputs and outputs to determine behaviors can provide insight into the principles of behavior. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the alterations in the neural circuits associated with AD-related behavioral and psychological symptoms. Interestingly, it is well known that the alteration of neural circuitry is prominent in the brains of patients with AD. Here, we selected specific regions in the AD brain that are associated with AD-related behavioral and psychological symptoms, and reviewed studies of healthy and altered efferent pathways to the target regions. Moreover, we propose that specific neural circuits that are altered in the AD brain can be potential targets for AD treatment. Furthermore, we provide therapeutic implications for targeting neuronal circuits through various therapeutic approaches and the appropriate timing of treatment for AD.

TI  - Study protocol for the Alzheimer and music therapy study: An RCT to compare the efficacy of music therapy and physical activity on brain plasticity, depressive symptoms, and cognitive decline, in a population with and at risk for Alzheimer's disease
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   There is anecdotal evidence for beneficial effects of music therapy in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, there is a lack of rigorous research investigating this issue. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of music therapy and physical activity on brain plasticity, mood, and cognition in a population with AD and at risk for AD.
   Methods
   One-hundred and thirty-five participants with memory complaints will be recruited for a parallel, three-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Inclusion criteria are a diagnosis of mild (early) AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or memory complaints without other neuropsychiatric pathology. Participants are randomised into either a music therapy intervention (singing lessons), an active control group (physical activity) or a passive control group (no intervention) for 12 months. The primary outcomes are the brain age gap, measured via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes include cognitive performance, activities of daily living, brain structure (voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging), and brain function (resting-state functional MRI).
   Trial status
   Screening of participants began in April 2018. A total of 84 participants have been recruited and started intervention, out of which 48 participants have completed 12 months of intervention and post-intervention assessment.
   Discussion
   Addressing the need for rigorous longitudinal data for the effectiveness of music therapy in people with and at risk for developing AD, this trial aims to enhance knowledge regarding cost-effective interventions with potentially high clinical applicability.

TI  - The role of the motor system in action naming in patients with neurodegenerative extrapyramidal syndromes
T2  - CORTEX
AB  - Previous studies of patients with brain damage have suggested a close relationship between aphasia and movement disorders. Neurodegenerative extrapyramidal syndromes associated with cognitive impairment provide an interesting model for studying the neural substrates of cognitive and motor symptoms.
   In this review, we focused on studies investigating language production abilities in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). According to some reports, these patients exhibit a reduction in performance in both action and object naming or verb production compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, a disproportional impairment of action naming compared to object naming was systematically observed in patients with these disorders.
   The study of these clinical conditions offers the unique opportunity to examine the close link between linguistic features and motor characteristics of action. This particular pattern of language impairment may contribute to the debate on embodiment theory and on the involvement of the basal ganglia in language and in integrating language and movement.
   From a translational perspective, we suggest that language ability assessments are useful in the clinical work-up, along with neuropsychological and motor evaluations. Specific protocols should be developed in the near future to better characterize language deficits and to permit an early cognitive diagnosis. Moreover, the link between language deficits and motor impairment opens a new issue for treatment approaches. Treatment of one of these two symptoms may ameliorate the other, and treating both may produce a greater improvement in patients' global clinical conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - tDCS-enhanced motor and cognitive function in neurological diseases
T2  - NEUROIMAGE
AB  - Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation tool that is now being widely used in neuroscientific and clinical research in humans. While initial studies focused on modulation of cortical excitability, the technique quickly progressed to studies on motor and cognitive functions in healthy humans and in patients with neurological diseases. In the present review we will first provide the reader with a brief background on the basic principles of tDCS. In the main part, we will outline recent studies with tDCS that aimed at enhancing behavioral outcome or disease-specific symptoms in patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, movement disorders, and epilepsy, or persistent deficits after stroke. The review will close with a summary statement on the present use of tDCS in the treatment of neurological disorders, and an outlook to further developments in this realm. tDCS may be an ideal tool to be administered in parallel to intensive cognitive or motor training in neurological disease, but efficacy for the areas of activities and participation still needs to be established in controlled randomized trials. Its use in reducing disease-specific symptoms like dystonia or epileptic seizures is still unclear. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lifetime History of Depression Predicts Increased Amyloid-β Accumulation in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Mounting evidence associates a lifetime history of major depression (LMD) with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have shown that major depression (MD) is strongly linked to pathophysiological markers of AD, such as cortical amyloid-beta (A beta) burden. However, no imaging studies have shown in vivo whether an LMD is linked to increased A beta accumulation in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in four cortical regions that have been highly associated with increased A beta deposition in previous literature: frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal. Drawing from the ADNI database, we found that patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and an LMD (n = 39) had significantly higher F-18-Florbetapir standardized uptake value ratios, a surrogate measure of A beta deposition, mainly in the bilateral frontal cortex, compared to patients with aMCI without an LMD (n = 39) (p = 0.02). This difference was not explained by current depressive symptoms, vascular risk factors, or the use of different PET scanners. The results were reliable employing two independent methods for analysis: region-of-interest and voxel-based analyses. Increased A beta in the bilateral frontal lobes may be a biomarker of depressive symptomology in aMCI patients. Further studies should test whether higher A beta predicts future conversion into AD in this population.

TI  - Freezing of gait: understanding the complexity of an enigmatic phenomenon
T2  - BRAIN
AB  - Diverse but complementary methodologies are required to uncover the complex determinants and pathophysiology of freezing of gait. To develop future therapeutic avenues, we need a deeper understanding of the disseminated functional anatomic network its temporally associated dynamic processes. In this targeted review, we wilt summarize the latest advances across multiple methodological domains including clinical phenomenology, neurogenetics, multimodal neuroimaging, neurophysiology, and neuromodulation. We found that (i) locomotor network vulnerability is established by structural damage, e.g. from neurodegeneration possibly as result from genetic variability, or to variable degree from brain lesions. This leads to an enhanced network susceptibility, where (ii) modulators can both increase or decrease the threshold to express freezing of gait. Consequent to a threshold decrease, (iii) neuronal integration failure of a multilevel brain network will occur and affect one or numerous nodes and projections of the multilevel network. Finally, (iv) an ultimate pathway might encounter failure of effective motor output and give rise to freezing of gait as clinical endpoint. In conclusion, we derive key questions from this review that challenge this pathophysiological view. We suggest that future research on these questions should lead to improved pachophysiological insight and enhanced therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Overview of the cholinergic contribution to gait, balance and falls in Parkinson's disease
T2  - PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS
AB  - Mobility deficits, including gait disturbance, balance impairments and falls, are common features of Parkinson's disease (PD) that negatively impact quality of life. Mobility deficits respond poorly to dopaminergic medications, indicating a role for additional neurotransmitters. Due to the critical role of cortical input to gait and balance, acetylcholine-an essential neurotransmitter system for attention has become an area of interest for mobility. This review aimed to identify the role of cholinergic function on gait, balance, and falls in PD using three techniques; pharmacological, imaging, and electrophysiological. Studies supported the role of the cholinergic system for mobility in PD, with the most promising evidence indicating a role in falls. Imaging studies demonstrated involvement of anterior cholinergic (basal forebrain) systems in gait, and posterior (brainstem) systems in balance. However, this review identified a small number of studies which used varying protocols, making comparisons difficult. Further studies are warranted, measuring comprehensive gait and balance characteristics as well as gold standard falls detection to further quantify the relationship between ACh and mobility in PD.

TI  - Brain phylogeny, ontogeny and dysfunction: integrating evolutionary, developmental and clinical perspectives in cognitive neuroscience
T2  - ACTA NEUROPSYCHIATRICA
AB  - Objective: One of the most popular approaches in cognitive neuroscience has been to study the normal adult human brain. However, there are likely to be limits to the knowledge that can be obtained from such studies. If we assume that no single approach can ever provide us with knowledge of causative processes whereby the mind emerges from the brain, then we need to consider how to combine more disparate approaches. I aim to illustrate here how the parallel study of brain phylogeny, ontogeny and dysfunction may bring us towards an integrative understanding of fundamental aspects of cognitive neuroscience.
   Methods: A review of published literature in these research areas was carried out and representative articles selected.
   Results: Comparative approaches, utilizing the extraordinary behavioural abilities as well as the structural and functional variants that evolution has thrown up across diverse groups of species, can inform the core neural systems that may be necessary and sufficient to support specific cognitive processes. Similarly, detailed studies of human brain development, focusing on structural and functional maturation correlated with temporal mapping of cognitive processes as they come 'on-line', may provide unique mechanistic insights. Finally, the study of brain dysfunction in neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and depression, may have the beneficial side-effect of greatly enhancing our understanding of healthy brain function.
   Conclusion: Each approach has its own epistemological advantages and disadvantages, but combined they may lead to more sophisticated, and empirically testable, models. In this review, I outline evidence for their utility, illustrate the approaches using specific examples and suggest how new advances in fields such as genomics, neurophysiology and neuroimaging may provide unprecedented opportunities in cognitive neuroscience.

TI  - Network neuroscience of apathy in cerebrovascular disease
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Apathy is a reduction in motivated goal-directed behavior (GDB) that is prevalent in cerebrovascular disease, providing an important opportunity to study the mechanistic underpinnings of motivation in humans. Focal lesions, such as those seen in stroke, have been crucial in developing models of brain regions underlying motivated behavior, while studies of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) have helped define the connections between brain regions supporting such behavior. However, current lesion-based models cannot fully explain the neurobiology of apathy in stroke and SVD. To address this, we propose a network-based model which conceptualizes apathy as the result of damage to GDB-related networks. A review of the current evidence suggests that cerebrovascular disease-related pathology can lead to network changes outside of initially damaged territories, which may propagate to regions that share structural or functional connections. The presentation and longitudinal trajectory of apathy in stroke and SVD may be the result of these network changes. Distinct subnetworks might support cognitive components of GDB, the disruption of which results in specific symptoms of apathy. This network-based model of apathy may open new approaches for investigating its underlying neurobiology, and presents novel opportunities for its diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Stroke research at the crossroads - where are we heading?
T2  - SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
AB  - Stroke causes 5.7 million deaths annually. This ranks stroke as the second most common cause of death and, additionally, it is a major cause of disability. Because of an ageing population, stroke incidence and costs will greatly increase in the future. This makes stroke an ongoing social and economic burden, in contrast to the only very limited therapeutic options. In the last decade vast sums were spent on translational research focused on neuroprotective strategies in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke. A plethora of candidate agents were tested in experimental models and preclinical studies, but none was proven effective in clinical trials. This gave rise to discussions about the possible reasons for this failure, ending up mainly with criticism of methodological aspects of the preclinical and clinical studies, or of the relevance of animal studies in drug development. Indeed, the question could rather be whether neuroprotection is the right target for successful stroke treatment. In this context, a paradigm change can currently be observed: the focus of experimental and translational stroke research is shifting from early neuroprotection to delayed mechanisms such as stroke-associated comorbidities, regeneration and plasticity. In this review we highlight a few recently emerging fields in translational stroke research. One such topic is the crosstalk between immunity and the injured brain as key pathomechanism in stroke. On one hand, innate and adaptive immune cells play an important role in the fate of injured brain tissue after stroke; on the other, peripheral immune alterations are critically involved in post-stroke comorbidities. Another emerging research area is the analysis of mechanisms involved in regeneration and neuronal plasticity after stroke. Here, we discuss the current understanding of basic mechanisms involved after brain injury, clinical imaging approaches and therapeutic strategies to promote regeneration in stroke patients.

TI  - Resting State Cortical Rhythms in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: Electroencephalographic Evidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Physiological brain aging is characterized by a combination of synaptic pruning, loss of cortico-cortical connections and neuronal apoptosis that provoke age-dependent decline of cognitive functions. Neural/synaptic redundancy and plastic remodeling of brain networking, also secondary to mental and physical training, promotes maintenance of brain activity in healthy elderly for everyday life and fully productive affective and intellectual capabilities. Unfortunately, in pathological situations, aging triggers neurodegenerative processes that impact on cognition, like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oscillatory electromagnetic brain activity is a hallmark of neuronal network function in various brain regions. Modern neurophysiological techniques including digital electroencephalography (EEG) allow non-invasive analysis of cortico-cortical connectivity and neuronal synchronization of firing, and coherence of brain rhythmic oscillations at various frequencies. The present review of field EEG literature suggests that discrimination between physiological and pathological brain aging clearly emerges at the group level, with some promising result on the informative value of EEG markers at the individual level. Integrated approaches utilizing neurophysiological techniques together with biological markers and structural and functional imaging are promising for large-scale, low-cost, widely available on the territory and non-invasive screening of at-risk populations.

TI  - Hyperactivity Induced by Soluble Amyloid-β Oligomers in the Early Stages of Alzheimer's Disease
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (A beta o) start to accumulate in the human brain one to two decades before any clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are implicated in synapse loss, one of the best predictors of memory decline that characterize the illness. Cognitive impairment in AD was traditionally thought to result from a reduction in synaptic activity which ultimately induces neurodegeneration. More recent evidence indicates that in the early stages of AD synaptic failure is, at least partly, induced by neuronal hyperactivity rather than hypoactivity. Here, we review the growing body of evidence supporting the implication of soluble A beta o on the induction of neuronal hyperactivity in AD animal models, in vitro, and in humans. We then discuss the impact of A beta o-induced hyperactivity on memory performance, cell death, epileptiform activity, gamma oscillations, and slow wave activity. We provide an overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are emerging to explain how A beta o induce neuronal hyperactivity. We conclude by providing an outlook on the impact of hyperactivity for the development of disease-modifying interventions at the onset of AD.

TI  - Recent Advances and Future Directions in Brain MR Imaging Studies in Schizophrenia: Toward Elucidating Brain Pathology and Developing Clinical Tools
T2  - MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Schizophrenia is a common severe psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of general population through the life course. Historically, in Kraepelin's time, schizophrenia was a disease unit conceptualized as dementia praecox; however, since then, the disease concept has changed. Recent MRI studies had shown that the neuropathology of the brain in this disorder was characterized by mild progression before and after the onset of the disease, and that the brain alterations were relatively smaller than assumed. Although genetic factors contribute to the brain alterations in schizophrenia, which are thought to be trait differences, other changes include factors that are common in psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, it has been shown that the brain differences specific to schizophrenia were relatively small compared to other changes, such as those caused by brain development, aging, and gender. In addition, compared to the disease and participant factors, machine and imaging protocol differences could affect MRI signals, which should be addressed in multi-site studies. Recent advances in MRI modalities, such as multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and multimodal brain imaging analysis, may be candidates to sharpen the characterization of schizophrenia-specific factors and provide new insights. The Brain/MINDS Beyond Human Brain MRI (BMB-HBM) project has been launched considering the differences and noises irrespective of the disease pathologies and includes the future perspectives of MRI studies for various psychiatric and neurological disorders. The sites use restricted MRI machines and harmonized multi-modal protocols, standardized image preprocessing, and traveling subject harmonization. Data sharing to the public will be planned in FY 2024. In the future, we believe that combining a high-quality human MRI dataset with genetic data, randomized controlled trials, and MRI for non-human primates and animal models will enable us to understand schizophrenia, elucidate its neural bases and therapeutic targets, and provide tools for clinical application at bedside.

TI  - Current emerging novel therapies for Alzheimer's disease and the future prospects of magneto-mechanical force therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease among the elderly, and the morbidity increases with the aging population aggravation. The clinical symptoms of AD mainly include cognitive impairment and memory loss, which undoubtedly bring a huge burden to families and society. Currently, the drugs in clinical use only improve the symptoms of AD but do not cure or prevent the progression of the disease. Therefore, it is urgent for us to develop novel therapeutic strategies for effective AD treatment. To provide a better theoretical basis for exploring novel therapeutic strategies in future AD treatment, this review introduces the recent AD treatment technologies from three aspects, including nanoparticle (NP) based drug therapy, biological therapy and physical therapy. The nanoparticle-mediated therapeutic approaches at the nanomaterial-neural interface and biological system are described in detail, and in particular the magneto-regulated strategies by magnetic field actuating magnetic nanoparticles are highlighted. Promising application of magneto-mechanical force regulated strategy in future AD treatment is also addressed, which offer possibilities for the remote manipulation in a precise manner. In the future, it may be possible for physicians to realize a remote, precise and effective therapy for AD using magneto-mechanical force regulated technology based on the combination of magnetic nanoparticles and an external magnetic field.
   This article introduces the latest AD treatment techniques from three aspects: drug therapy, biological therapy and physical therapy. Nanoparticle-mediated therapeutics at nanomaterial-neural interfaces and biological systems are described in detail.

TI  - Heterogeneous Brain Abnormalities in Schizophrenia Converge on a Common Network Associated With Symptom Remission
T2  - SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN
AB  - Background and Hypothesis There is a huge heterogeneity of magnetic resonance imaging findings in schizophrenia studies. Here, we hypothesized that brain regions identified by structural and functional imaging studies of schizophrenia could be reconciled in a common network.Study Design We systematically reviewed the case-control studies that estimated the brain morphology or resting-state local function for schizophrenia patients in the literature. Using the healthy human connectome (n = 652) and a validated technique "coordinate network mapping" to identify a common brain network affected in schizophrenia. Then, the specificity of this schizophrenia network was examined by independent data collected from 13 meta-analyses. The clinical relevance of this schizophrenia network was tested on independent data of medication, neuromodulation, and brain lesions.Study Results We identified 83 morphological and 60 functional studies comprising 7389 patients with schizophrenia and 7408 control subjects. The "coordinate network mapping" showed that the atrophy and dysfunction coordinates were functionally connected to a common network although they were spatially distant from each other. Taking all 143 studies together, we identified the schizophrenia network with hub regions in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, insula, temporal lobe, and subcortical structures. Based on independent data from 13 meta-analyses, we showed that these hub regions were specifically connected with regions of cortical thickness changes in schizophrenia. More importantly, this schizophrenia network was remarkably aligned with regions involving psychotic symptom remission.Conclusions Neuroimaging abnormalities in cross-sectional schizophrenia studies converged into a common brain network that provided testable targets for developing precise therapies.

TI  - Structural Neuroimaging of the Medial Temporal Lobe in Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Atrophy in the medial temporal lobe (MTA) is being used as a criterion to support a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are several structural neuroimaging approaches for quantifying MTA, including semiquantitative visual rating scales, volumetry (3D), planimetry (2D), and linear measures (1D). Current applications of structural neuroimaging in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials (ADCTs) incorporate it as a tool for improving the selection of subjects for enrollment or for stratification, for tracking disease progression, or providing evidence of target engagement for new therapeutic agents. It may also be used as a surrogate marker, providing evidence of disease-modifying effects. However, despite the widespread use of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in ADCTs, there are some important challenges and limitations, such as difficulties in the interpretation of results, limitations in translating results into clinical practice, and reproducibility issues, among others. Solutions to these issues may arise from other methodologies that are able to link the results of volumetric MRI from trials with conventional MRIs performed in routine clinical practice (linear or planimetric methods). Also of potential benefit are automated volumetry, using indices for comparing the relative rate of atrophy of different regions instead of absolute rates of atrophy, and combining structural neuroimaging with other biomarkers. In this review, authors present the existing structural neuroimaging approaches for MTA quantification. They then discuss solutions to the limitations of the different techniques as well as the current challenges of the field. Finally, they discuss how the current advances in AD neuroimaging can help AD diagnosis.

TI  - Alzheimer's disease as a disconnection syndrome?
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOLOGY REVIEW
AB  - This paper reviews the growing amount of evidence supporting the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease includes a disconnection syndrome. This evidence came mainly from neuropathological, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging studies. Moreover, a few recent neuropsychological studies have also explored the effects of a disconnection between cerebral areas on cognitive functioning. Finally, and more generally, the contribution of this interpretation to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease cognitive deficits is considered.

TI  - Reward and emotion: an affective neuroscience
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
AB  - Pleasure and reward are central for motivation, learning, feeling and allostasis. Although reward is without any doubt an affective phenomenon, there is no consensus concerning its relationship with emotion. In this mini-review we discuss this conceptual issue both from the perspective of theories of reward and emotion as well as human systems neuroimaging. We first describe how the reward process can be understood and dissected as intertwined with the emotion process, in particular in light of the appraisal theories, and then discuss how different facets of the reward process can be studied using neuroimaging and neurostimulation techniques. We conclude that future work needs to focus on mapping the similarities and differences across stimuli and mechanisms that are involved in reward processing and in emotional processing, and propose that an integrative affective sciences approach would provide means for studying the emotional nature of reward.

TI  - Where do we stand now regarding treatment of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders? Considerations in using magnetoelectric nanoparticles as an innovative approach
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-NANOMEDICINE AND NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Almost 1000 million people have recently been diagnosed with a mental health or substance disorder (Ritchie & Roser, 2018). Psychiatric disorders, and their treatment, represent a big burden to the society worldwide, causing about 8 million deaths per year (Walker et al., 2015). Daily progress in science enables continuous advances in methods to treat patients; however, the brain remains to be the most unknown and complex organ of the body. There is a growing demand for innovative approaches to treat psychiatric as well as neurodegenerative disorders, disorders with unknown curability, and treatments mostly designed to slow disease progression. Based on that need and the peculiarity of the central nervous system, in the present review, we highlight the handicaps of the existing approaches as well as discuss the potential of the recently introduced magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENPs) to become a game-changing tool in future applications for the treatment of brain alterations. Unlike other stimulation approaches, MENPs have the potential to enable a wirelessly controlled stimulation at a single-neuron level without requiring genetic modification of the neural tissue and no toxicity has yet been reported. Their potential as a new tool for targeting the brain is discussed.

TI  - The immediate and delayed effects of single tDCS session over posterior parietal cortex on face-word associative memory
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Associative memory (AM), an ability to form and retrieve associations between information units is crucial for everyday functioning and is affected by aging as well as by different neurological conditions. It was shown that rTMS over posterior parietal cortex (PPC) can improve AM of face-word pairs. Therefore, we examined if tDCS will produce comparable effects and explore whether the effect would persist one and five days following the stimulation. Thirty-seven healthy participants took part in cross-over sham-controlled study in which they received 20 min of anodal (1.5 mA) or sham tDCS over left PPC. Following tDCS participants completed face-cued word recall and verbal fluency tasks. A randomly selected subsample (N = 18) has completed follow up memory assessments one and five days after the stimulation. Anodal tDCS facilitated AM performance in comparison to sham with the same trend persisting during the 5-day follow-up period. Additionally, participants with lower AM scores had higher relative gain following anodal tDCS. Anodal tDCS had no effect on the control task (verbal fluency). Results support the existence of a specific enhancing effect on AM produced by facilitatory neuro-modulation of the PPC. The effect was more prominent in low performers and it persisted at least 5 days post-stimulation. These findings support the robustness of tDCS effect on AM and provide a foundation for future research that could lead to its future clinical application.

TI  - The pharmacology of neuroplasticity induced by non-invasive brain stimulation: building models for the clinical use of CNS active drugs
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON
AB  - The term neuroplasticity encompasses structural and functional modifications of neuronal connectivity. Abnormal neuroplasticity is involved in various neuropsychiatric diseases, such as dystonia, epilepsy, migraine, Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal degeneration, schizophrenia, and post cerebral stroke. Drugs affecting neuroplasticity are increasingly used as therapeutics in these conditions. Neuroplasticity was first discovered and explored in animal experimentation. However, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has enabled researchers recently to induce and study similar processes in the intact human brain. Plasticity induced by NIBS can be modulated by pharmacological interventions, targeting ion channels, or neurotransmitters. Importantly, abnormalities of plasticity as studied by NIBS are directly related to clinical symptoms in neuropsychiatric diseases. Therefore, a core theme of this review is the hypothesis that NIBS-induced plasticity can explore and potentially predict the therapeutic efficacy of CNS-acting drugs in neuropsychiatric diseases. We will (a) review the basics of neuroplasticity, as explored in animal experimentation, and relate these to our knowledge about neuroplasticity induced in humans by NIBS techniques. We will then (b) discuss pharmacological modulation of plasticity in animals and humans. Finally, we will (c) review abnormalities of plasticity in neuropsychiatric diseases, and discuss how the combination of NIBS with pharmacological intervention may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of abnormal plasticity in these diseases and their purposeful pharmacological treatment.

TI  - Translational approaches to influence sleep and arousal
T2  - BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN
AB  - Sleep disorders are widespread in society and are prevalent in military personnel and in Veterans. Disturbances of sleep and arousal mechanisms are common in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety and affective disorders, traumatic brain injury, dementia, and substance use disorders. Sleep disturbances exacerbate suicidal ideation, a major concern for Veterans and in the general population. These disturbances impair quality of life, affect interpersonal relationships, reduce work productivity, exacerbate clinical features of other disorders, and impair recovery. Thus, approaches to improve sleep and modulate arousal are needed. Basic science research on the brain circuitry controlling sleep and arousal led to the recent approval of new drugs targeting the orexin/hypocretin and histamine systems, complementing existing drugs which affect GABAA receptors and monoaminergic systems. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques to modulate sleep and arousal are safe and show potential but require further development to be widely applicable. Invasive viral vector and deep brain stimulation approaches are also in their infancy but may be used to modulate sleep and arousal in severe neurological and psychiatric conditions. Behavioral, pharmacological, non-invasive brain stimulation and cell-specific invasive approaches covered here suggest the potential to selectively influence arousal, sleep initiation, sleep maintenance or sleep-stage specific phenomena such as sleep spindles or slow wave activity. These manipulations can positively impact the treatment of a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders by promoting the restorative effects of sleep on memory consolidation, clearance of toxic metabolites, metabolism, and immune function and by decreasing hyperarousal.

TI  - Interventional programmes to improve cognition during healthy and pathological ageing: Cortical modulations and evidence for brain plasticity
T2  - AGEING RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that healthy elderly individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease retain an important potential for neuroplasticity. This review summarizes studies investigating the modulation of neural activity and structural brain integrity in response to interventions involving cognitive training, physical exercise and non-invasive brain stimulation in healthy elderly and cognitively impaired subjects (including patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease). Moreover, given the clinical relevance of neuroplasticity, we discuss how evidence for neuroplasticity can be inferred from the functional and structural brain changes observed after implementing these interventions. We emphasize that multimodal programmes, which combine several types of interventions, improve cognitive function to a greater extent than programmes that use a single interventional approach. We suggest specific methods for weighting the relative importance of cognitive training, physical exercise and non-invasive brain stimulation according to the functional and structural state of the brain of the targeted subject to maximize the cognitive improvements induced by multimodal programmes.

TI  - Non-invasive brain stimulation to enhance cognitive rehabilitation after stroke
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB  - Stroke is a main cause for long-term disability. Stroke symptoms cover various domains, e.g., motor, sensory, language, or other cognitive functions. In clinical practice and rehabilitation research, especially motor impairment attracts much attention. However, also cognitive impairments are common after stroke, effecting approximately two-thirds of stroke patients in the acute phase. Although 30% of stroke patients spontaneously recover from their cognitive impairments, large amounts of patients remain cognitively impaired. These patients have more problems reintegrating in personal and professional life. To date, cognitive rehabilitation strategies are not yet satisfactory. One promising strategy is combining non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) with cognitive training. In the current review, we will discuss the relevance of cognitive impairment after stroke and innovative interventional strategies to improve cognition, such as NIBS. Furthermore, we will address the potential of using cognitive training to enhance recovery in other behavioural domains, such as the motor domain.

TI  - Advances in Neurocognitive Rehabilitation Research From 1992 to 2017: The Ascension of Neural Plasticity
T2  - NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Objective: The last 25 years have seen profound changes in neurocognitive rehabilitation that continue to motivate its evolution. Although the concept of nervous system plasticity was discussed by William James (1890), the foundation for experience-based plasticity had not reached the critical empirical mass to seriously impact rehabilitation research until after 1992. The objective of this review is to describe how the emergence of neural plasticity has changed neurocognitive rehabilitation research. Method: The important developments included (a) introduction of a widely available tool that could measure brain plasticity (i.e., functional MRI); (b) development of new structural imaging techniques that could define limits of and opportunities for neural plasticity; (c) deployment of noninvasive brain stimulation to leverage neural plasticity for rehabilitation; (d) growth of a literature indicating that exercise has positively impacts neural plasticity, especially for older persons; and (e) enhancement of neural plasticity by creating interventions that generalize beyond the boundaries of treatment activities. Given the massive literature, each of these areas is developed by example. Results: The expanding influence of neural plasticity has provided new models and tools for neurocognitive rehabilitation in neural injuries and disorders, as well as methods for measuring neural plasticity and predicting its limits and opportunities. Early clinical trials have provided very encouraging results. Conclusion: Now that neural plasticity has gained a firm foothold, it will continue to influence the evolution of neurocognitive rehabilitation research for the next 25 years and advance rehabilitation for neural injuries and disease.
   General Scientific Summary
   Neural plasticity refers to the ability of the nervous system to change in response to experience, and because it is responsible for our ability to learn new facts and procedures, it is the foundation for all neurorehabilitation. This review describes how the concept of neural plasticity, the application of its principles, and the ability to induce it and measure it have revolutionized neurocognitive rehabilitation research for neural injuries and disorders over the last 25 years. Developments in this area have given us a greater understanding of brain-behavior changes underlying rehabilitation, which is allowing rehabilitation scientists to devise exciting new approaches.

TI  - Depression in neurodegenerative diseases: Common mechanisms and current treatment options
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder and a major cause of disability worldwide. This neurological condition is commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), and has a significant impact on the increasing burden of these neuropathologies. Over the past decades, some of the pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms that contribute to these diseases have been elucidated and these findings indicate that, despite presenting distinct features, there are several similarities between the neurobiological alterations that lead to MDD and neurodegeneration in AD, PD, and HD. For instance, disturbances in monoaminergic transmission and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, increased oxidative and neuroinfiammatory events, and impaired trophic support are thought to contribute to neuronal atrophy and death in all these diseases. In addition, neuroimaging findings have helped elucidate the structural and functional changes implicated in the relationship between depression and neurodegeneration, thus establishing a neuroanatomical signature to explain, at least in part, the comorbidity between MDD and AD, PD, and HD. The present review summarizes these findings and the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of common antidepressant therapies for the treatment of MDD in patients with these neurodegenerative diseases. This population is particularly vulnerable to the drawdowns of conventional antidepressant therapy (namely inadequate response and high risk of side effects), and the development of emerging therapeutic approaches to treat MDD in patients with AD, PD, and HD is thus of paramount importance to improve the quality of life of these individuals.

TI  - Psychotropic Drug Development Strategies that Target Neuropsychiatric Etiologies in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases
T2  - DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Neuropsychiatric symptoms are currently recognized as a common burden in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and many other neurodegenerative disorders. Earlier theories positing that these symptoms emerge predominantly in patients with late-stage disease have been largely dismissed. It is now generally accepted that many neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly manifest very early in neurodegenerative disease stages, and in many cases are even considered prodromal indicators. Despite intense research efforts, no reliable drug treatment strategies have been found for the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with AD and PD. Among the medications commonly used at this stage, many present significant risks for patients in this particular cohort. Transcriptomic tools and proteomic profiling have clearly indicated that neurodegenerative diseases and their associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities are multifactorial in origin. As such, multipleand in many cases divergentdisease etiologies lead to the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with AD, PD, and other neurodegenerative disorders. The complexity of these pathways (initiated by a cascade of molecular events that involve several neurotransmitter systems) offer significant challenges to drug discovery efforts aimed at addressing these symptoms. In response to this complexity, a new paradigm has emerged that challenges the widely held assumption that targeted drug design is superior to the development of multi-targeted drugs as a strategy to address the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with AD and PD. In this Overview, I offer an overview of drug discovery strategies and investigative drugs currently under development that address multiple CNS etiological targets associated with an array of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

TI  - How do we get from hyperexcitability to excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?
T2  - BRAIN
AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that, at present, has no effective cure. Evidence of increased circulating glutamate and hyperexcitability of the motor cortex in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have provided an empirical support base for the 'dying forward' excitotoxicity hypothesis. The hypothesis postulates that increased activation of upper motor neurons spreads pathology to lower motor neurons in the spinal cord in the form of excessive glutamate release, which triggers excitotoxic processes. Many clinical trials have focused on therapies that target excitotoxicity via dampening neuronal activation, but not all are effective. As such, there is a growing tension between the rising tide of evidence for the 'dying forward' excitotoxicity hypothesis and the failure of therapies that target neuronal activation.One possible solution to these contradictory outcomes is that our interpretation of the current evidence requires revision in the context of appreciating the complexity of the nervous system and the limitations of the neurobiological assays we use to study it. In this review we provide an evaluation of evidence relevant to the 'dying forward' excitotoxicity hypothesis and by doing so, identify key gaps in our knowledge that need to be addressed. We hope to provide a road map from hyperexcitability to excitotoxicity so that we can better develop therapies for patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.We conclude that studies of upper motor neuron activity and their synaptic output will play a decisive role in the future of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy.
   Odierna et al. evaluate preclinical and clinical evidence for brain-initiated toxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and identify key roadblocks and gaps in understanding that must be tackled in order to develop effective therapies.

TI  - Biomarkers for major depression and its delineation from neurodegenerative disorders
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
AB  - Major depressive disorders (MDD) are among the most debilitating diseases worldwide and occur with a high prevalence in elderly individuals. Neurodegenerative diseases (in particular Alzheimer's disease, AD) do also show a strong age-dependent increase in incidence and prevalence among the elderly population. A high number of geriatric patients with MDD show cognitive deficits and a very high proportion of AD patients present co-morbid MDD, which poses difficult diagnostic and prognostic questions. Especially in prodromal and in very early stages of AD, it is almost impossible to differentiate between pure MDD and MDD with underlying AD.
   Here, we give a comprehensive review of the literature on the current state of candidate biomarkers for MDD ("positive MDD markers") and briefly refer to established and validated diagnostic AD biomarkers in order to rule out underlying AD pathophysiology in elderly MDD subjects with cognitive impairments ("negative MDD biomarkers"). In summary, to date there is no evidence for positive diagnostic MDD biomarkers and the only way to delineate MDD from AD is to use "negative MDD" biomarkers.
   Because of this highly unsatisfactory current state of MDD biomarker research, we propose a research strategy targeting to detect and validate positive MDD biomarkers, which is based on a complex (genetic, molecular and neurophysiological) biological model that incorporates current state of the art knowledge on the pathobiology of MDD. This model delineates common pathways and the intersection between AD and MDD. Applying these concepts to MDD gives hope that positive MDD biomarkers can be successfully identified in the near future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Primary lateral sclerosis: The era of international diagnosis criteria
T2  - REVUE NEUROLOGIQUE
AB  - Since Charcot's first description, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) remains a rare clinical syndrome, a neuropathological phenotype of motor system degeneration. in turn, PLS has been described as belonging to the large spectrum of motoneuron diseases or to the diverse degenerative diseases of the nervous system. Clinically, it is characterized by progressive pyramidal involvement in patients who present insidiously progressive gait disorders and, on examination, have relatively symmetrical lower limb weakness, increased muscle tone, pathologic hyper-reflexia, and exaggerated extensor plantar responses. Pinprick, light touch, and temperature sensations are preserved. Viewed in another way, PLS mimicks progressive hereditary spastic paraparesis (HSP) and the "central" phenotype of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). PLS is considered "idiopathic" and, depending on the presence or absence of similarly affected family members, the syndrome of idiopathic HSP and ALS are labeled "hereditary" or "apparently sporadic". The juvenile form of PLS and early age at onset in cases of HSP complicate our understanding of the relationship between these two disorders. Guidelines for diagnosis and genetic counseling have been published for HSP and ALS. Recently, since the first international workshop, guidelines for diagnosis of PLS propose a classification system, e.g. for heterogeneous HSP into "pure PLS", complicated or "plus PLS", symptomatic PLS and upper motor neuron-dominant ALS. However, when reviewing known cases of PLS drawn from the literature, rigorous retrospective application of these new PLS criteria raises an unanswered question: does pure PLS exist?

TI  - How to Characterize the Function of a Brain Region
T2  - TRENDS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Many brain regions have been defined, buta comprehensive formalization of each region's function in relation to human behavior is still lacking. Current knowledge comes from various fields, which have diverse conceptions of 'functions'. We briefly review these fields and outline how the heterogeneity of associations could be harnessed to disclose the computational function of any region. Aggregating activation data from neuroimaging studies allows us to characterize the functional engagement of a region across a range of experimental conditions. Furthermore, large-sample data can disclose covariation between brain region features and ecological behavioral phenotyping. Combining these two approaches opens a new perspective to determine the behavioral associations of a brain region, and hence its function and broader role within large-scale functional networks.

TI  - Yoga: Balancing the excitation-inhibition equilibrium in psychiatric disorders
T2  - MEDITATION
CP  - International Conference on Meditation
AB  - Social behavioral disturbances are central to most psychiatric disorders. A disequilibrium within the cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems underlies these deficits. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate are the most abundant excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain that contribute to this equilibrium. Several contemporary therapies used in treating psychiatric disorders, regulate this GABA-glutamate balance. Yoga has been studied as an adjuvant treatment across a broad range of psychiatric disorders and is shown to have short-term therapeutic gains. Emerging evidence from recent clinical in vivo experiments suggests that yoga improves GABA-mediated cortical-inhibitory tone and enhances peripheral oxytocin levels. This is likely to have a more controlled downstream response of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal system by means of reduced cortisol release and hence a blunted sympathetic response to stress. Animal and early fetal developmental studies suggest an inter-dependent role of oxytocin and GABA in regulating social behaviors. In keeping with these observations, we propose an integrated neurobiological model to study the mechanisms of therapeutic benefits with yoga. Apart from providing a neuroscientific basis for applying a traditional system of practice in the clinical setting, this model can be used as a framework for studying yoga mechanisms in future clinical trials.

AB  - Despite the numerous challenges associated with the application of nanotechnology in neuroscience, it promises to have a significant impact on our understanding of how the nervous system works, how it fails in disease, and the development of earlier and less-invasive diagnostic procedures so we can intervene in the pre-clinical stage of neurological disease before extensive neurological damage has taken place. Ultimately, both the challenges and opportunities that nanotechnology presents stem from the fact that this technology provides a way to interact with neural cells at the molecular level. In this review we provide a neurobiological overview of key neurological disorders, describe the different types of nanomaterials in use and discuss their current and potential uses in neuroscience. We also discuss the issue of toxicity in these nanomaterials. This review presents many of the different applications that advances in nanotechnology are having in the field of neurological sciences, especially the high impact they are having in the development of new treatment modalities for neurological disorders that will induce the expected physiological response while minimizing undesirable secondary effects. In conclusion, we weigh in on what the promises and challenges are for future development in this groundbreaking field.

TI  - Circadian disruption and sleep disorders in neurodegeneration
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL NEURODEGENERATION
AB  - Disruptions of circadian rhythms and sleep cycles are common among neurodegenerative diseases and can occur at multiple levels. Accumulating evidence reveals a bidirectional relationship between disruptions of circadian rhythms and sleep cycles and neurodegenerative diseases. Circadian disruption and sleep disorders aggravate neurodegeneration and neurodegenerative diseases can in turn disrupt circadian rhythms and sleep. Importantly, circadian disruption and various sleep disorders can increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, harnessing the circadian biology findings from preclinical and translational research in neurodegenerative diseases is of importance for reducing risk of neurodegeneration and improving symptoms and quality of life of individuals with neurodegenerative disorders via approaches that normalize circadian in the context of precision medicine. In this review, we discuss the implications of circadian disruption and sleep disorders in neurodegenerative diseases by summarizing evidence from both human and animal studies, focusing on the bidirectional links of sleep and circadian rhythms with prevalent forms of neurodegeneration. These findings provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and suggest a promising role of circadian-based interventions.

TI  - The road ahead in clinical network neuroscience
T2  - NETWORK NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Clinical network neuroscience, the study of brain network topology in neurological and psychiatric diseases, has become a mainstay field within clinical neuroscience. Being a multidisciplinary group of clinical network neuroscience experts based in The Netherlands, we often discuss the current state of the art and possible avenues for future investigations. These discussions revolve around questions like How do dynamic processes alter the underlying structural network? and Can we use network neuroscience for disease classification? This opinion paper is an incomplete overview of these discussions and expands on ten questions that may potentially advance the field. By no means intended as a review of the current state of the field, it is instead meant as a conversation starter and source of inspiration to others.

TI  - Brain stimulation methods for pain treatment
T2  - GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOPHYSICS
AB  - Treatment of pain is one of the most important aims of medicine. Over the past several decades, invasive, semi-invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation methods have been tested and implemented for modulation of the pain. In this review, we bring an overview of those methods including stimulation of both deep brain structures utilizing invasive and semi-invasive techniques and the brain cortex stimulated by non-invasive transcranial magnetic and electrical techniques. Another potentially beneficial method that could modulate pain by stimulating the deep brain with interferential transcranial alternating current is discussed as well.

TI  - Neurovascular coupling impairment as a mechanism for cognitive deficits in COVID-19
T2  - BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Components that comprise our brain parenchymal and cerebrovascular structures provide a homeostatic environment for proper neuronal function to ensure normal cognition. Cerebral insults (e.g. ischaemia, microbleeds and infection) alter cellular structures and physiologic processes within the neurovascular unit and contribute to cognitive dysfunction. COVID-19 has posed significant complications during acute and convalescent stages in multiple organ systems, including the brain. Cognitive impairment is a prevalent complication in COVID-19 patients, irrespective of severity of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, overwhelming evidence from in vitro, preclinical and clinical studies has reported SARS-CoV-2-induced pathologies in components of the neurovascular unit that are associated with cognitive impairment. Neurovascular unit disruption alters the neurovascular coupling response, a critical mechanism that regulates cerebromicrovascular blood flow to meet the energetic demands of locally active neurons. Normal cognitive processing is achieved through the neurovascular coupling response and involves the coordinated action of brain parenchymal cells (i.e. neurons and glia) and cerebrovascular cell types (i.e. endothelia, smooth muscle cells and pericytes). However, current work on COVID-19-induced cognitive impairment has yet to investigate disruption of neurovascular coupling as a causal factor. Hence, in this review, we aim to describe SARS-CoV-2's effects on the neurovascular unit and how they can impact neurovascular coupling and contribute to cognitive decline in acute and convalescent stages of the disease. Additionally, we explore potential therapeutic interventions to mitigate COVID-19-induced cognitive impairment. Given the great impact of cognitive impairment associated with COVID-19 on both individuals and public health, the necessity for a coordinated effort from fundamental scientific research to clinical application becomes imperative. This integrated endeavour is crucial for mitigating the cognitive deficits induced by COVID-19 and its subsequent burden in this especially vulnerable population.
   Owens et al. determined SARS-CoV-2 as a driver of neurovascular unit disruption and cognitive impairment. In this review, they were the first to propose neurovascular uncoupling as a mechanism for COVID-19-induced cognitive deterioration.

TI  - Language recovery following stroke
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST
AB  - Objective: To review the research literature pertaining to post-stroke language recovery, and to discuss neurocognitive assessment in patients in the context of aphasia, time course of language recovery, factors associated with language recovery, and therapeutic techniques designed to facilitate language recovery. Method: Articles were identified through PubMed, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Google Scholar searches. Examples of utilized keywords include "post-stroke aphasia," "post-stroke language recovery," "post-stroke neurocognitive assessment," and "neuropsychology and aphasia." Results: Most language recovery occurs in the first few weeks following stroke, but residual recovery may occur for many years. Although initial aphasia severity is the single largest determinant of post-stroke language recovery, a number of other variables also contribute. Several techniques have been developed to aid in the recovery process including speech-language therapy and noninvasive brain stimulation, although the effectiveness of acute and subacute treatment remains unclear. Some degree of valid neurocognitive assessment is possible in patients with aphasia, and the information gained from such an evaluation can aid the rehabilitative process Conclusions: Significant recovery of language function is possible following a stroke, but prediction of level of recovery in an individual patient is difficult. Information about initial aphasia severity and the integrity of cognitive domains other than language can help guide the rehabilitation team, as well as manage expectations for recovery.

TI  - The influence of genetic factors on brain plasticity and recovery after neural injury
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY
AB  - Purpose of review
   The fields of clinical genetics and pharmacogenetics are rapidly expanding. Genetic factors have numerous associations with injury and with treatment effects in the setting of neural plasticity and recovery.
   Recent findings
   Evidence is reviewed that established genetic variants, as well as some more recently described variants, are related to outcome after neural injury and in some cases are useful for predicting clinical course. In many cases, the interaction of genetics with clinical factors such as experience and therapy may be important. As an extension of this, genetic factors have been associated with differential response to a number of forms of therapy, including pharmacological, brain stimulation, psychotherapy, and meditation. Genetic variation might also have a significant effect on plasticity and recovery through key covariates such as depression or stress. A key point is that genetic associations might be most accurately identified when studied in relation to distinct forms of a disorder rather than in relation to broad clinical syndromes.
   Summary
   Understanding genetic variation gives clinicians a biological signal that could be used to predict who is most likely to recover from neural injury, to choose the optimal treatment for a patient, or to supplement rehabilitation therapy.

TI  - Mechanisms and therapeutic implications of the placebo effect in neurological and psychiatric conditions
T2  - PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
AB  - The power of a placebo to effect clinically meaningful neurobiological change comparable to pharmacological therapies has been demonstrated, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. Predicting placebo responsiveness has only recently received more attention, but psychological disposition, contextual and biological factors are now known to dramatically affect a person's susceptibility to the placebo effect. The placebo effect depends upon expectancies that can be modified in a number of ways, including conditioning through explicit or implicit learned associations. Based on the dopaminergic response to anticipation of benefit in Parkinson's disease, it was suggested that the placebo effect can be seen as analogous to the expectation of reward. Dopaminergic pathways have since been implicated in the placebo response in pain and depression. Additionally, endogenous opioid release is known to mediate many forms of placebo analgesia.
   We provide an overview of the mechanisms and the therapeutic implications of the placebo effect in neurological and psychiatric conditions. We include evidence for detrimental effects arising from seemingly inert interventions, termed-the 'nocebo-effect.' Neuroimaging has-critically, advanced-the study of the placebo effect and provides some of the strongest evidence for the mechanisms of this phenomenon prevalent across an array of human health-related circumstances. This review specifically focuses on mechanisms of the placebo effect in the three conditions that have most significantly demonstrated this effect and for which a plausible physiological basis can be identified: pain, PD and depression. Other neurological and psychiatric diseases reviewed include multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Resting EEG sources correlate with attentional span in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Previous evidence has shown that resting delta and alpha electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms are abnormal in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its potential preclinical stage (mild cognitive impairment, MCI). Here, we tested the hypothesis that these EEG rhythms are correlated with memory and attention in the continuum across MCI and AD. Resting eyes-closed EEG data were recorded in 34 MCI and 53 AD subjects. EEG rhythms of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), and beta 2 (20-30 Hz). EEG cortical sources were estimated by low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). These sources were correlated with neuropsychological measures such as Rey list immediate recall (word short-term memory), Rey list delayed recall (word medium-term memory), Digit span forward (immediate memory for digits probing focused attention), and Corsi span forward (visuo-spatial immediate memory probing focused attention). A statistically significant negative correlation (Bonferroni corrected, P < 0.05) was observed between Corsi span forward score and amplitude of occipital or temporal delta sources across MCI and AD subjects. Furthermore, a positive correlation was shown between Digit span forward score and occipital alpha 1 sources (Bonferroni corrected, P < 0.05). These results suggest that cortical sources of resting delta and alpha rhythms correlate with neuropsychological measures of immediate memory based on focused attention in the continuum of MCI and AD subjects.

TI  - Evolving Evidence for the Value of Neuroimaging Methods and Biological Markers in Subjects Categorized with Subjective Cognitive Decline
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - There is evolving evidence that individuals categorized with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are potentially at higher risk for developing objective and progressive cognitive impairment compared to cognitively healthy individuals without apparent subjective complaints. Interestingly, SCD, during advancing preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), may denote very early, subtle cognitive decline that cannot be identified using established standardized tests of cognitive performance. The substantial heterogeneity of existing SCD-related research data has led the Subjective Cognitive Decline Initiative (SCD-I) to accomplish an international consensus on the definition of a conceptual research framework on SCD in preclinical AD. In the area of biological markers, the cerebrospinal fluid signature of AD has been reported to be more prevalent in subjects with SCD compared to healthy controls; moreover, there is a pronounced atrophy, as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging, and an increased hypometabolism, as revealed by positron emission tomography, in characteristic brain regions affected by AD. In addition, SCD individuals carrying an apolipoprotein epsilon 4 allele are more likely to display AD-phenotypic alterations. The urgent requirement to detect and diagnose AD as early as possible has led to the critical examination of the diagnostic power of biological markers, neurophysiology, and neuroimaging methods for AD-related risk and clinical progression in individuals defined with SCD. Observational studies on the predictive value of SCD for developing AD may potentially be of practical value, and an evidence-based, validated, qualified, and fully operationalized concept may inform clinical diagnostic practice and guide earlier designs in future therapy trials.

TI  - Fasciculation intensity and disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: To investigate the association between the frequency and intensity of fasciculations with clinical measures of disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
   Methods: Twenty-four consecutive patients with ALS underwent clinical review and neuromuscular ultrasound assessment to detect intensity of fasciculations. Results were correlated with clinical markers of disease severity, as measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R) and rate of disease progression (Delta FS), in addition to assessment of cortical motor function.
   Results: Disease duration negatively correlated (R = -0.530, p < 0.01) with fasciculation intensity, while the Delta FS positively correlated with the fasciculation number (R = 0.626, p < 0.01). In terms of potential central contributions to ectopic impulse generation, patients were classified into cohorts based on their fasciculation intensity and short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). AFS was significantly higher in patients with established hyperexcitability (low SICI) with high fasciculation intensity compared to those patients with minimal SICI change.
   Conclusions: Fasciculation intensity appears linked to disease progression and separately to markers of cortical dysfunction, specifically the advent of cortical hyperexcitability.
   Significance: Assessment of the intensity of patient fasciculations is a noninvasive approach that may provide further insight disease pathophysiology in ALS. (C) 2018 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Human behavioral assessments in current research of Parkinson's disease
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally classified as a movement disorder because patients mainly complain about motor symptoms. Recently, non-motor symptoms of PD have been recognized by clinicians and scientists as early signs of PD, and they are detrimental factors in the quality of life in advanced PD patients. It is crucial to comprehensively understand the essence of behavioral assessments, from the simplest measurement of certain symptoms to complex neuropsychological tasks. We have recently reviewed behavioral assessments in PD research with animal models (Asakawa et al., 2016). As a companion volume, this article will systematically review the behavioral assessments of motor and non-motor PD symptoms of human patients in current research. The major aims of this article are: (1) promoting a comparative understanding of various behavioral assessments in terms of the principle and measuring indexes; (2) addressing the major strengths and weaknesses of these behavioral assessments for a better selection of tasks/tests in order to avoid biased conclusions due to inappropriate assessments; and (3) presenting new concepts regarding the development of wearable devices and mobile internet in future assessments. In conclusion we emphasize the importance of improving the assessments for non-motor symptoms because of their complex and unique mechanisms in human PD brains. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Drugs, games, and devices for enhancing cognition: implications for work and society
T2  - YEAR IN COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - As work environments change, the demands on working people change. Cognitive abilities in particular are becoming progressively more important for work performance and successful competition in a global environment. However, work-related stress, performance over long hours, lack of sleep, shift work, and jet lag affect cognitive functions. Therefore, an increasing number of healthy people are reported to use cognitive-enhancing drugs, as well as other interventions, such as noninvasive brain stimulation, to maintain or improve work performance. This review summarizes research on pharmacological and technical methods as well as cognitive training, including game apps for the brain, in healthy people. In neuropsychiatric disorders, impairments in cognitive functions can drastically reduce the chances of returning to work; therefore, this review also summarizes findings from pharmacological and cognitive-training studies in neuropsychiatric disorders.

TI  - Alzheimer's Disease, Neural Plasticity, and Functional Recovery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common and devastating neurodegenerative condition worldwide, characterized by the aggregation of amyloid-beta and phosphorylated tau protein, and is accompanied by a progressive loss of learning and memory. A healthy nervous system is endowed with synaptic plasticity, among others neural plasticity mechanisms, allowing structural and physiological adaptations to changes in the environment. This neural plasticity modification sustains learning and memory, and behavioral changes and is severely affected by pathological and aging conditions, leading to cognitive deterioration. This article reviews critical aspects of AD neurodegeneration as well as therapeutic approaches that restore neural plasticity to provide functional recoveries, including environmental enrichment, physical exercise, transcranial stimulation, neurotrophin involvement, and direct electrical stimulation of the amygdala. In addition, we report recent behavioral results in Octodon degus, a promising natural model for the study of AD that naturally reproduces the neuropathological alterations observed in AD patients during normal aging, including neuronal toxicity, deterioration of neural plasticity, and the decline of learning and memory.

TI  - Integration of epidemiologic, pharmacologic, genetic and gut microbiome data in a drug-metabolite atlas
T2  - NATURE MEDICINE
AB  - Progress in high-throughput metabolic profiling provides unprecedented opportunities to obtain insights into the effects of drugs on human metabolism. The Biobanking BioMolecular Research Infrastructure of the Netherlands has constructed an atlas of drug-metabolite associations for 87 commonly prescribed drugs and 150 clinically relevant plasma-based metabolites assessed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The atlas includes a meta-analysis of ten cohorts (18,873 persons) and uncovers 1,071 drug-metabolite associations after evaluation of confounders including co-treatment. We show that the effect estimates of statins on metabolites from the cross-sectional study are comparable to those from intervention and genetic observational studies. Further data integration links proton pump inhibitors to circulating metabolites, liver function, hepatic steatosis and the gut microbiome. Our atlas provides a tool for targeted experimental pharmaceutical research and clinical trials to improve drug efficacy, safety and repurposing. We provide a web-based resource for visualization of the atlas (http://bbmri.researchlumc.nl/atlas/).

TI  - Understanding cognition and how it changes with aging, brain disease, and lifestyle choices
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND
AB  - Human cognition is supported by diverse brain networks that undergo change throughout adulthood and can be impacted by brain disease. This review summarises some of the significant progress made by cognitive neuroscientists in elucidating the impact of adult aging and age-related brain diseases on these complex cognitive networks, which are now known to also be affected by lifestyle choices. In combination with neurological patient research, neuroimaging tools such as near-infrared spectroscopy have enabled cognitive neuroscientists to characterise the dynamic nature of cognitive brain networks and identify potential therapeutic targets for improving cognitive functioning. Meanwhile research into the cognitive benefits of some lifestyle choices has started to reveal some more global means through which people can improve their cognitive functioning, and has also pointed towards some potentially fruitful avenues for combination therapies. In consideration of functional reorganisation occurring with brain aging and disease, here it is proposed that targeting newly recruited brain regions that act under natural circumstances in a compensatory manner to support better functioning in the face of deterioration, thus ameliorating cognitive loss, may enable scientists to tap into and boost naturally occurring mechanisms. Moreover, pairing such a targeted intervention with a global intervention may serve to magnify benefits.

TI  - Neurological impressions on the organization of language networks in the human brain
T2  - BRAIN INJURY
AB  - Background: More than 95% of right-handed individuals, as well as almost 80% of left-handed individuals, have left hemisphere dominance for language. The perisylvian networks of the dominant hemisphere tend to be the most important language systems in human brains, usually connected by bidirectional fibres originated from the superior longitudinal fascicle/arcuate fascicle system and potentially modifiable by learning. Neuroplasticity mechanisms take place to preserve neural functions after brain injuries. Language is dependent on a hierarchical interlinkage of serial and parallel processing areas in distinct brain regions considered to be elementary processing units. Whereas aphasic syndromes typically result from injuries to the dominant hemisphere, the extent of the distribution of language functions seems to be variable for each individual. Method: Review of the literature Results: Several theories try to explain the organization of language networks in the human brain from a point of view that involves either modular or distributed processing or sometimes both. The most important evidence for each approach is discussed under the light of modern theories of organization of neural networks. Conclusions: Understanding the connectivity patterns of language networks may provide deeper insights into language functions, supporting evidence-based rehabilitation strategies that focus on the enhancement of language organization for patients with aphasic syndromes.

TI  - Can neuromodulation techniques optimally exploit cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit properties to enhance motor learning post-stroke?
T2  - REVIEWS IN THE NEUROSCIENCES
AB  - Individuals post-stroke sustain motor deficits years after the stroke. Despite recent advancements in the applications of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and Deep Brain Stimulation in humans, there is a lack of evidence supporting their use for rehabilitation after brain lesions. Non-invasive brain stimulation is already in use for treating motor deficits in individuals with Parkinson's disease and post-stroke. Deep Brain Stimulation has become an established treatment for individuals with movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, epilepsy, cerebral palsy and dystonia. It has also been utilized for the treatment of Tourette's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and neuropsychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression and anorexia nervosa. There exists growing scientific knowledge from animal studies supporting the use of Deep Brain Stimulation to enhance motor recovery after brain damage. Nevertheless, these results are currently not applicable to humans. This review details the current literature supporting the use of these techniques to enhance motor recovery, both from human and animal studies, aiming to encourage development in this domain.

TI  - Unfolding the Role of BDNF as a Biomarker for Treatment of Depression
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Depression is a well-known disabling mental illness characterized by sadness, loss of interest in activities, and decreased energy. The symptoms of depression are usually recurrent in vulnerable individuals, and persistence of symptoms significantly impairs individuals' quality of life. The exact pathophysiology of depression remains ambiguous, though many hypotheses have been proposed. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has recently been reported to play a vital role in the pathophysiology of depression. BDNF is an important neurotrophic factor found in the human brain and is involved in neuronal growth and proliferation, synaptic neurotransmission, and neuroplasticity. The neurotrophic theory of depression proposes that depression results from reduced BDNF levels in the brain, which can be treated with antidepressants to alleviate depressive behavior and increase BDNF levels. The aim of this review is to provide broad insight into the role of BDNF in the pathogenesis of depression and in antidepressant therapy. The studies mentioned in this review article greatly support the role of BDNF in the pathogenesis of depression and treatment of this disorder with antidepressants. Since abnormalities in BDNF levels lead to the production of diverse insults that amplify the development or progression of depression, it is important to study and explore BDNF impairment in relation to depression, neuroplasticity, and neurogenesis, and increasing BDNF levels through antidepressant therapy, showing positive response in the management of depression.

TI  - Mechanisms of Cortical Neural Synchronization Related to Healthy and Impaired Consciousness: Evidence by Quantitative Electroencephalographic Studies
T2  - CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB  - In this paper, we review the contribution of our research group to the study of human consciousness by quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques. We posit that EEG techniques can be extremely useful for a direct measurement of brain electrophysiological activity related to human consciousness for their unsurpassable high temporal resolution (milliseconds). This activity can be expressed in terms of event-related potentials as well as changes of EEG rhythms of interest, for example the dominant alpha rhythms (about 8-12 Hz). The results of our studies, and those of several independent groups, lead support to the hypothesis that these techniques provide important insights about the neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying cortical neural synchronization/desynchronization and the regulation of neuromodulatory systems (e.g. dopaminergic, noradrenergic, cholinergic, etc.) at the basis of brain arousal and consciousness in healthy subjects and in patients with impairment of the consciousness. A possible interaction of these mechanisms and the drugs administered to patients with consciousness disorders is discussed.

TI  - Efficacy and Time Course of Theta Burst Stimulation in Healthy Humans
T2  - BRAIN STIMULATION
AB  - Background: In the past decade research has shown that continuous (cTBS) and intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) alter neuronal excitability levels in the primary motor cortex.
   Objective: Quantitatively review the magnitude and time course on cortical excitability of cTBS and iTBS.
   Methods: Sixty-four TBS studies published between January 2005 and October 2014 were retrieved from the scientific search engine PubMED and included for analyses. The main inclusion criteria involved stimulation of the primary motor cortex in healthy volunteers with no motor practice prior to intervention and motor evoked potentials as primary outcome measure.
   Results: ITBS applied for 190 s significantly increases cortical excitability up to 60 min with a mean maximum potentiation of 35.54 +/- 3.32%. CTBS applied for 40 s decreases cortical excitability up to 50 min with a mean maximum depression of -22.81 +/- 286%, while cTBS applied for 20 s decreases cortical excitability (mean maximum -27.84 +/- 4.15%) for 20 min.
   Conclusion: The present findings offer normative insights into the magnitude and time course of TBS-induced changes in cortical excitability levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intermittent theta burst stimulation combined with cognitive training improves cognitive dysfunction and physical dysfunction in patients with post-stroke cognitive impairment
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Objective: Post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is a common complication of stroke. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) can inducing motor learning. We observed the effects of combination of iTBS with cognitive training on physical/cognitive dysfunctions in PSCI patients. Methods: PSCI patients treated with basic treatment & cognitive training (Control group)/iTBS & cognitive training (iTBS group) were enrolled, with Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE)/Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)/Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB)/barthel index (BI)/Upper Limb Fugl-Meyer Assessment (UFMA)/Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores compared. Gait spatiotemporal parameters/dynamic parameters were analyzed by 3D gait analysis. Correlations between MMSE/MoCA scores and gait parameters in PSCI patients after iTBS & cognitive training were analyzed by Spearman analysis. Results: Increased MMSE/MoCA/FAB/BI/U-FMA/ARAT scores, step speed, step frequency, stride length, step width, step length on the affected side, percentage of swing phase on the affected side, hip joint flexion angle on the affected side, knee joint flexion angle on the affected side, and ankle plantar flexion angle on the affected side and reduced gait period on the affected side and percentage of stance phase on the affected side were found in patients of both groups after treatment, with the effects in the iTBS group more profound. Conclusion: iTBS & cognitive training obviously improved the cognitive function scores/upper limb function scores/gait parameters in PSCI patients versus cognitive training treatment. After combination therapy, the MMSE/MoCA scores of PSCI patients were significantly correlated with gait parameters. This provided more data support for iTBS & cognitive training application in the rehabilitation treatment of PSCI patients.

TI  - Episodic memory in aspects of large-scale brain networks
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Understanding human episodic memory in aspects of large-scale brain networks has become one of the central themes in neuroscience over the last decade. Traditionally, episodic memory was regarded as mostly relying on medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. However, recent studies have suggested involvement of more widely distributed cortical network and the importance of its interactive roles in the memory process. Both direct and indirect neuro-modulations of the memory network have been tried in experimental treatments of memory disorders. In this review, we focus on the functional organization of the MTL and other neocortical areas in episodic memory. Task-related neuroimaging studies together with lesion studies suggested that specific sub-regions of the MTL are responsible for specific components of memory. However, recent studies have emphasized that connectivity within MTL structures and even their network dynamics with other cortical areas are essential in the memory process. Resting-state functional network studies also have revealed that memory function is subserved by not only the MTL system but also a distributed network, particularly the defaultmode network (DMN). Furthermore, researchers have begun to investigate memory networks throughout the entire brain not restricted to the specific resting-state network (RSN). Altered patterns of functional connectivity (FC) among distributed brain regions were observed in patients with memory impairments. Recently, studies have shown that brain stimulation may impact memory through modulating functional networks, carrying future implications of a novel interventional therapy for memory impairment.

TI  - Harnessing neuroplasticity: modern approaches and clinical future
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Background and purpose: Neurological diseases and injuries to the nervous system may cause inadvertent damage to neuronal and synaptic structures. Such phenomenon would lead to the development of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders which might affect memory, cognition and motoric functions. The body has various negative feedback systems which can induce beneficial neuroplastic changes in mediating some neuronal damage; however, such efforts are often not enough to ameliorate the derogatory changes. Materials and methods: Articles discussing studies to induce beneficial neuroplastic changes were retrieved from the databases, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and MEDLINE, and reviewed. Results: This review highlights the significance of neuroplasticity in restoring neuronal functions and current advances in research to employ this positive cellular event by inducing synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, clearance of toxic amyloid beta (A beta) and tau protein aggregates, or by providing neuroprotection. Compounds ranging from natural products (e.g. bilobalides, curcumin) to novel vaccines (e.g. AADvac1, RG7345) have been reported to induce long-lasting neuroplasticity in vitro and in vitro. Activity-dependent neuroplasticity is also inducible by regimens of exercises and therapies with instances in human studies proving major successes. Lastly, mechanical stimulation of brain regions through therapeutic hypothermia or deep brain stimulation has given insight on the larger scale of neuroplasticity within the nervous system. Conclusion: Harnessing neuroplasticity may not only offer an arm in the vast arsenal of approaches being taken to tackle neurological disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases, but from ample evidence, it also has major implications in neuropsychological disorders.

TI  - Functional brain mapping: overview of techniques and their application to neurosurgery
T2  - NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW
AB  - Functional brain mapping (FBM) is an integral part of contemporary neurosurgery. It is crucial for safe and optimal resection of brain lesions like gliomas. The eloquent regions of the cortex like motor, somatosensory, Wernicke's, and Broca are usually mapped, either preoperatively or intraoperatively. Since its birth in the nineteenth century, FBM has witnessed immense modernization, radical refinements, and the introduction of novel techniques, most of which are non-invasive. Direct electrical stimulation of the cortex, despite its high invasiveness, remains the technique of choice. Non-invasive techniques like fMRI and magnetoencephalography allow us the convenience of multiple mappings with minimal discomfort to the patients. They are quick, easy to do, and allow thorough study. Different modalities are now being combined to yield better delineations like fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging. This article reviews the physical principles, applications, merits, shortcomings, and latest developments of nine FBM techniques. Other than neurosurgical operations, these techniques have also been applied to studies of stroke, Alzheimer's, and cognition. There are strong indications that the future of brain mapping shall see the non-invasive techniques playing a more dominant role as they become more sensitive and accurate due to advances in physics, refined algorithms, and subsequent validation against invasive techniques.

TI  - The cerebellum and cognition
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
AB  - What the cerebellum does to sensorimotor and vestibular control, it also does to cognition, emotion, and autonomic function. This hypothesis is based on the theories of dysmetria of thought and the universal cerebellar transform, which hold that the cerebellum maintains behavior around a homeostatic baseline, automatically, without conscious awareness, informed by implicit learning, and performed according to context. Functional topography within the cerebellum facilitates the modulation of distributed networks subserving multiple different functions. The sensorimotor cerebellum is represented in the anterior lobe with a second representation in lobule VIII, and lesions of these areas lead to the cerebellar motor syndrome of ataxia, dysmetria, dysarthria and impaired oculomotor control. The cognitive / limbic cerebellum is in the cerebellar posterior lobe, with current evidence pointing to three separate topographic representations, the nature of which remain to be determined. Posterior lobe lesions result in the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (CCAS), the hallmark features of which include deficits in executive function, visual spatial processing, linguistic skills and regulation of affect. The affective dyscontrol manifests in autism spectrum and psychosis spectrum disorders, and disorders of emotional control, attentional control, and social skill set. This report presents an overview of the rapidly growing field of the clinical cognitive neuroscience of the cerebellum. It commences with a brief historical background, then discusses tract tracing experiments in animal models and functional imaging observations in humans that subserve the cerebellar contribution to neurological function. Structure function correlation studies following focal cerebellar lesions in adults and children permit a finer appreciation of the functional topography and nature of the cerebellar motor syndrome, cerebellar vestibular syndrome, and the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology - the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome. The ability to detect the CCAS in real time in clinical neurology with a brief and validated scale should make it possible to develop a deeper understanding of the clinical consequences of cerebellar lesions in a wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders with a link to the cerebellum.

TI  - Noninvasive Brain Stimulation for the Study of Memory Enhancement in Aging
T2  - EUROPEAN PSYCHOLOGIST
AB  - Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques have recently attracted interest due to their potential for transiently improving cognition. This may prove particularly valuable in aging, given the known impact of age-related cognitive dysfunction on quality of life. The present review summarizes the currently available evidence of working and episodic memory enhancements achieved using NIBS in healthy elderly people. The evidence reviewed indicates that research is still at an early stage and that there is a need to define the best procedures for operating and performing multicentre characterization of protocols. However, a limited number of sham-controlled studies have reported improvements in both cognitive domains. Furthermore, evidences of long-term beneficial effects opens up the possibility of using NIBS as an adjuvant therapeutic strategy. However, the relevance of certain variables involved and approaches used remains to be elucidated, including the potential benefits of single versus multiple NIBS sessions, the putative synergistic effects of using NIBS in combination with cognitive training, and the importance of individual differences. Overall, NIBS techniques represent a promising opportunity for psychologists seeking strategies to improve memory functions in the elderly. Nevertheless, their use requires appropriate technical knowledge coupled with a clear understanding of the neurophysiology and cognitive neuroscience of aging.

TI  - Maximizing placebo response in neurological clinical practice
T2  - PLACEBO EFFECTS IN NEUROLOGIC DISEASE
AB  - The placebo effect is a widely recognized phenomenon in clinical research, with a negative perception that it could hide the "true" drug effect. In clinical care its positive potential to increase known drug effects has been neglected for too long. The placebo and nocebo responses have been described in many neurologic disorders such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases, restless leg syndrome, tics, essential tremor, dystonia, functional movement disorders, neuropathic pain, headaches, migraine, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. Knowledge regarding placebo mechanisms and their consequences on clinical outcome have greatly improved over the last two decades. This evolution has led to reconsiderations of the importance of placebo response in the clinic and has given several clues on how to improve it in daily practice.
   In this chapter, we first illustrate "why," e.g. the reasons (relevance to clinical practice, help in differential diagnosis/treatment of psychogenic movements, clinical impact, proven neurobiological grounds, health economic potential), and "how," e.g. the means (increase patients' knowledge, increase learning, improve patient-doctor relationship, increase Hawthorne effect, increase positive/decrease negative expectations (the Rosenthal effect), personalize placebo response), the placebo should be maximized (and nocebo avoided) in neurological clinical practice. Future studies regarding more specific neurobiological mechanisms will allow a finer tuning of placebo response in clinical practice. The use of placebo in clinical practice raises ethical issues, and a recent expert consensus regarding placebo use in the clinic is a first step to future guidelines necessary to this field.

TI  - A Human Depression Circuit Derived From Focal Brain Lesions
T2  - BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Focal brain lesions can lend insight into the causal neuroanatomical substrate of depression in the human brain. However, studies of lesion location have led to inconsistent results.
   METHODS: Five independent datasets with different lesion etiologies and measures of postlesion depression were collated (N = 461). Each 3-dimensional lesion location was mapped to a common brain atlas. We used voxel lesion symptom mapping to test for associations between depression and lesion locations. Next, we computed the network of regions functionally connected to each lesion location using a large normative connectome dataset (N = 1000). We used these lesion network maps to test for associations between depression and connected brain circuits. Reproducibility was assessed using a rigorous leave-one-dataset-out validation. Finally, we tested whether lesion locations associated with depression fell within the same circuit as brain stimulation sites that were effective for improving poststroke depression.
   RESULTS: Lesion locations associated with depression were highly heterogeneous, and no single brain region was consistently implicated. However, these same lesion locations mapped to a connected brain circuit, centered on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Results were robust to leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation. Finally, our depression circuit derived from brain lesions aligned with brain stimulation sites that were effective for improving poststroke depression.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lesion locations associated with depression fail to map to a specific brain region but do map to a specific brain circuit. This circuit may have prognostic utility in identifying patients at risk for poststroke depression and therapeutic utility in refining brain stimulation targets.

TI  - Classification of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Using Distance Correlation on Resting-State Functional MRI Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS
AB  - Both the Pearson correlation and partial correlation methods have been widely used in the resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) studies. However, they can only measure linear relationship, although partial correlation excludes some indirect effects. Recent distance correlation can discover both the linear and non-linear dependencies. Our goal was to use the multivariate pattern analysis to compare the ability of such three correlation methods to distinguish between the patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and healthy control subjects (HCSs), so as to find optimal correlation method. The main process includes four steps. First, the regions of interest are defined by automated anatomical labeling (AAL). Second, functional connectivity (FC) matrices are constructed by the three correlation methods. Third, the best discriminative features are selected by support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) with a stratified N-fold cross-validation strategy. Finally, these discriminative features are used to train a classifier. We had a total of 128 subjects out of which 61 subjects had OCD and 67 subjects were normal. All the three correlation methods with SVM have achieved good results, among which distance correlation is the best [accuracy = 93.01%, specificity = 89.71%, sensitivity = 95.08%, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.94], followed by Pearson correlation and partial correlation is the last. The most discriminative regions of the brain for distance correlation are right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, orbital part of left superior frontal gyrus, orbital part of right middle frontal gyrus, right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, left the supplementary motor area, and right precuneus, which are the promising biomarkers of OCD.

TI  - Oscillotherapeutics - Time-targeted interventions in epilepsy and beyond
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH
AB  - Oscillatory brain activities support many physiological functions from motor control to cognition. Disruptions of the normal oscillatory brain activities are commonly observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, anxiety/trauma-related disorders, major depressive disorders, and drug addiction. Therefore, these disorders can be considered as common oscillation defects despite having distinct behavioral manifestations and genetic causes. Recent technical advances of neuronal activity recording and analysis have allowed us to study the pathological oscillations of each disorder as a possible biomarker of symptoms. Furthermore, recent advances in brain stimulation technologies enable time- and space-targeted interventions of the pathological oscillations of both neurological disorders and psychiatric disorders as possible targets for regulating their symptoms.

TI  - Neurostimulation techniques to enhance sleep and improve cognition in aging
T2  - NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE
AB  - Sleep plays a critical role in the process of memory consolidation. In particular, during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) slow wave sleep, slow-oscillations, spindles, hippocampal sharp wave ripples, and their phase coupling are involved in the process of transferring and consolidating information recently encoded and temporarily stored in the hippocampus into long-term memory stored in the neocortex. There is evidence that aging and neurodegenerative conditions, in particular Alzheimer's disease, are associated with changes to this transient grouping of NREM oscillations. Therefore, methods to enhance sleep, particularly slow wave sleep, have the potential to improve cognitive performance. Transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation have been shown useful to enhance sleep slow-waves and sleep-dependent memory consolidation, however there is need for more information regarding proper protocols of application and applicability and efficacy in patients with neurodegenerative conditions. Acoustic stimulation during sleep has been proven particularly effective in enhancing sleep slow-waves and spindles with associated improvement in overnight memory consolidation. More importantly, preliminary data indicate that similar results can be achieved in healthy older adults and those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Studies are needed to optimize the modalities of acoustic stimulation during sleep, which may vary based on age group or clinical disorder. Overall, non-invasive techniques of neurostimulation may represent a valid approach to mitigate cognitive decline associated with aging and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, they offer the unique opportunity to improve our understanding of the physiology behind sleep-dependent memory consolidation.

TI  - Cranial electrotherapy stimulation affects mood state but not levels of peripheral neurotrophic factors or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation
T2  - TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE
AB  - Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is reported to aid in relieving symptoms of depression and anxiety, though the mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response and levels of neurotrophic factors, as well as changes in mood state, in patients undergoing CES therapy. Fifty healthy postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to either a Sham CES group (n -25) or an Active CES group (n - 25). CES treatment was conducted in 20-minute sessions, three times per week for 8 weeks, using a micro current cranial electrotherapy stimulator. Blood samples were collected prior to and following the 8week treatment period for measurement of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) levels. Changes in mood state were also examined at the time of blood collection using the Profile of Mood States (POMS). No significant differences in cortisol, ACTH, BDNF, or NGF were observed between the two participant groups (p > 0.05) following the treatment period. However, those in the Active CES group exhibited significantly decreased Tension-Anxiety and Depression-Dejection scores on the POMS relative to pre-treatment scores (p < 0.05). Furthermore, Depression-Dejection scores following treatment were significantly lower in the Active CES group than in the Sham CES group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in any other POMS scores such as Anger-Hostility, Vigor-Activity, Fatigue-Inertia, and Confusion-Bewilderment (p > 0.05). These results suggest that 8 weeks of CES treatment does not induce changes in blood levels of neurotrophic factors or HPA-axis-related hormones, though such treatment may be effective in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression.

TI  - NMDAR Neurotransmission Needed for Persistent Neuronal Firing: Potential Roles in Mental Disorders
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) generates the mental representations that are the foundation of abstract thought, and provides top-down regulation of emotion through projections to the medial PFC and cingulate cortices. Physiological recordings from dlPFC Delay cells have shown that the generation of mental representations during working memory relies on NMDAR neurotransmission, with surprisingly little contribution from AMPAR. Systemic administration of low "antidepressant" doses of the NMDAR antagonist, ketamine, erodes these representations and reduces dlPFC Delay cell firing. In contrast to the dlPFC, V1 neuronal firing to visual stimuli depends on AMPAR, with much less contribution from NMDAR. Similarly, neurons in the dlPFC that respond to sensory events (cue cells, response feedback cells) rely on AMPAR, and systemic ketamine increases their firing. Insults to NMDAR transmission, and the impaired ability for dlPFC to generate mental representations, may contribute to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, e.g., from genetic insults that weaken NMDAR transmission, or from blockade of NMDAR by kynurenic acid. Elevated levels of kynurenic acid in dlPFC may also contribute to cognitive deficits in other disorders with pronounced neuroinflammation (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), or peripheral infections where kynurenine can enter brain (e.g., delirium from sepsis, "brain fog" in COVID19). Much less is known about NMDAR actions in the primate cingulate cortices. However, NMDAR neurotransmission appears to process the affective and visceral responses to pain and other aversive experiences mediated by the cingulate cortices, which may contribute to sustained alterations in mood state. We hypothesize that the very rapid, antidepressant effects of intranasal ketamine may involve the disruption of NMDAR-generated aversive mood states by the anterior and subgenual cingulate cortices, providing a "foot in the door" to allow the subsequent return of top-down regulation by higher PFC areas. Thus, the detrimental vs. therapeutic effects of NMDAR blockade may be circuit dependent.

TI  - Relative or Absolute? Implications and Consequences of the Measures Adopted to Investigate Motor Overflow
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOTOR BEHAVIOR
AB  - Motor overflow is involuntary overt movement or covert muscle activity that cooccurs with voluntary movement. Overflow is present in several pathological conditions, as well as in neurologically healthy children and older adults, and can be induced in healthy young adults under effortful conditions. This motor phenomenon may provide insight into the underlying mechanisms and kinetic characteristics of voluntary and involuntary motor control in various populations. Although often measured behaviorally using force transduction techniques, different methods of calculating and presenting such overflow data have resulted in seemingly contradictory findings, with limited discussion of the advantages and limitations of different approaches. In this article, the authors examined the relevant literature to highlight significant methodological considerations for authors and readers conducting or appraising this type of research. Issues regarding the interpretation and reporting of findings are also discussed. Researchers are encouraged to continue using behavioral measures to create well-defined variables that enable the study of the kinematic characteristics of overflow, as these may offer promising new ways forward in better characterizing and understanding this intriguing movement phenomenon.

TI  - The impact of neuroscience on society: cognitive enhancement in neuropsychiatric disorders and in healthy people
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - In addition to causing distress and disability to the individual, neuropsychiatric disorders are also extremely expensive to society and governments. These disorders are both common and debilitating and impact on cognition, functionality and wellbeing. Cognitive enhancing drugs, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and methylphenidate, are used to treat cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, respectively. Other cognitive enhancers include specific computerized cognitive training and devices. An example of a novel form of cognitive enhancement using the technological advancement of a game on an iPad that also acts to increase motivation is presented. Cognitive enhancing drugs, such as methylphenidate and modafinil, which were developed as treatments, are increasingly being used by healthy people. Modafinil not only affects 'cold' cognition, but also improves 'hot' cognition, such as emotion recognition and task-related motivation. The lifestyle use of 'smart drugs' raises both safety concerns as well as ethical issues, including coercion and increasing disparity in society. As a society, we need to consider which forms of cognitive enhancement (e.g. pharmacological, exercise, lifelong learning) are acceptable and for which groups (e.g. military, doctors) under what conditions (e.g. war, shift work) and by what methods we would wish to improve and flourish.

TI  - SACCADE AND SMOOTH-PURSUIT IMPAIRMENT AFTER CEREBRAL HEMISPHERIC LESIONS
T2  - EUROPEAN NEUROLOGY
AB  - A number of cortical and subcortical areas are involved in the control of saccades and smooth pursuit, and lesions affecting these areas result in various ocular motor syndromes. Most of these syndromes are relatively subtle and have to be ascertained using recordings, because other brain areas may largely take over the function of a damaged area. Anterior cortical, posterior cortical, large and bilateral cortical, subcortical and degenerative cerebral lesions are successively reviewed. In the anterior part of the cerebral hemisphere, the frontal eye field (FEF), supplementary eye field (SEF) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), i.e area 46 of Brodmann, control eye movements. The FEF appears to be principally involved in the control of intentional saccades, in particular those made with a retinotopic reference system, and in smooth pursuit. The SEF could control saccades made with a spatiotopic reference system, and sequences of saccades (requiring a temporal working memory). The PFC could control the inhibition of unwanted reflexive saccades, and be involved in spatial memory used for programming all types of memory-guided saccades. In the posterior part of the cerebral hemisphere, the parietal eye field (PEF) is involved in the triggering of reflexive visually guided saccades, and the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas in smooth pursuit. Acute and large unilateral lesions usually result in transitory ipsilateral conjugate eye deviation. Bilateral lesions affecting both the FEF and the PEF result in severe saccade and smooth-pursuit paresis, whereas bilateral posterior temporoparietal lesions result in Balint's syndrome, consisting of both eye movement and visual-attention abnormalities. Subcortical lesions also result in various eye movement abnormalities, which have been little documented to date. Lastly, degenerative cerebral diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration result in more or less severe eye movement disturbances. Eye movement recordings may contribute to early differential diagnosis of some of these degenerative diseases.

TI  - Altered GABA-mediated information processing and cognitive dysfunctions in depression and other brain disorders
T2  - MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Cognitive dysfunctions, including impaired attention, learning, memory, planning and problem solving, occur in depressive episodes, often persist during remission, predict relapse, worsen with recurrent episodes, and are not treated by current antidepressants or other medications. Cognitive symptoms are also present in other psychiatric disorders, are a hallmark of aging, and define several late-life disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. This pervasive occurrence suggests either a non-specific outcome of a diseased brain, or a shared underlying pathology contributing to this symptom dimension. Recent findings suggest a role for altered GABAergic inhibition in cognitive symptoms. Cellular, molecular and biochemical studies in human subjects report changes affecting the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) system, specifically somatostatin-expressing (SST+) GABAergic interneurons, across brain disorders and during aging. SST+ neurons gate excitatory input onto pyramidal neurons within cortical microcircuits. Experimentally reducing the function of these neurons affects excitatory signal-to-noise ratio, reduces synchronized cellular and neural activity, and leads to cognitive dysfunctions. Conversely, augmenting SST+ cell post-synaptic alpha 5-GABA-A receptor activity has pro-cognitive efficacy in stress and aging models. Together, this suggests that reduced signaling of the SST+ neuron/alpha 5-GABA-A receptor pathway contributes to cognitive dysfunctions, and that it represents a novel therapeutic target for remediating mood and cognitive symptoms in depression, other psychiatric disorders and during aging.

TI  - Treatment-refractory schizophrenia: what is it and what has been done about it?
T2  - NEUROPSYCHIATRY
AB  - There has been a veritable explosion of research conducted for interventions that may be advantageous for the management of treatment-refractory schizophrenia. After a discussion of how to define treatment resistance or treatment refractoriness, obstacles to its accurate identification are presented. Randomized clinical trials that have tested antipsychotic monotherapies, antipsychotic combination therapies, nonantipsychotic augmentation strategies and nonpharmacological interventions are catalogued. Although clozapine has been a landmark medication, attempts to augment it have not resulted in any further breakthroughs of the same magnitude. Some logical candidates for augmentation have not been successful, including anticholinesterase inhibitors and other agents used to treat cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Antipsychotic combinations have resulted in incremental improvements at best. Research being done with antidepressant medications and with agents that impact on the glutamate receptor holds the greatest promise at this time.

TI  - Brain imaging of attentional networks in normal and pathological states
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The ability to image the human brain has provided a new perspective for neuropsychologists in their efforts to understand, diagnose, and treat insults to the human brain that might occur as the result of stroke, tumor, traumatic injury, degenerative disease, or errors in development. These new findings are the major theme of this special issue. In our article, we consider brain networks that carry out the functions of attention. We outline several such networks that have been studied in normal and pathological states. These include networks for orienting to sensory stimuli, for maintaining the alert state, and for orchestrating volitional control.
   There is evidence that these networks have a certain degree of anatomical and functional independence, but that they also interact in many practical situations. Damage to each of these networks, irrespective of the source, produces distinctive neuropsychological deficits. We consider the links between the etiology of the injury and changes in cognition and behavior and examine the role of brain imaging in the study of rehabilitation.

TI  - Pre- and poststimulus alpha rhythms are related to conscious visual perception: A high-resolution EEG study
T2  - CEREBRAL CORTEX
AB  - Conscious and unconscious visuospatial processes have been related to parietooccipital cortical activation as revealed by late visual-evoked potentials. Here the working hypothesis was that a specific pattern of pre- and poststimulus theta (about 4-6 Hz) and alpha (about 6-12 Hz) rhythms is differently represented during conscious compared with unconscious visuospatial processes. Electroencephalographic (EEG) data (128 channels) were recorded in normal adults during a visuospatial task. A cue stimulus appeared at the right or left (equal probability) monitor side for a "threshold time" inducing about 50% of correct recognitions. It was followed (2 s) by visual go stimuli at spatially congruent or incongruent position with reference to the cue location. Left (right) mouse button was clicked if the go stimulus appeared at the left (right) monitor side. Then, subjects said "seen" if they had detected the cue stimulus or "not seen" if missed (self-report). Sources of theta and alpha rhythms during seen and not seen EEG epochs were estimated by low-resolution electromagnetic brain topography software. Results showed that the prestimulus "low-band" (about 6-10 Hz) alpha rhythms in frontal, parietal, and occipital areas were stronger in power in the seen than in the not seen trials. After the visual stimulation, the power of the "high-band" (about 10-12 Hz) alpha rhythms in parietal and occipital areas decreased more in the seen than in the not seen trials. The present results suggest that visuospatial consciousness covary-presumably with a facilitatory effect-with the power of both pre- and poststimulus alpha rhythms.

TI  - Towards universal therapeutics for memory disorders
T2  - TRENDS IN PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Evidence is accumulating that many memory disorders, including those due to neurodegenerative diseases, traumatic brain injury (TBI), vascular disease, or abnormal brain development, share common features of memory-related pathology. Structural and functional deficits of synapses are at the core of the underlying pathophysiology, constituting a critical point of convergence in memory disorders. Memory therapeutics that target synaptic loss and dysfunction that is, to slow, halt, or reverse progression of the disorders at the level of synapses, via synaptogenic molecular cascades such as those of protein kinase C (PKC) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) - possess universal therapeutic value for many forms of memory disorder. They may be useful either as standalone interventions for patients with memory disorders or as adjuncts to drugs that target the underlying pathology.

TI  - On the cause of mental retardation in Down syndrome: extrapolation from full and segmental trisomy 16 mouse models
T2  - BRAIN RESEARCH REVIEWS
AB  - Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21, Ts21) is the most common known cause of mental retardation. In vivo structural brain imaging in young DS adults, and post-mortem studies, indicate a normal brain size after correction for height, and the absence of neuropathology. Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) shows normal brain glucose metabolism, but fewer significant correlations between metabolic rates in different brain regions than in controls, suggesting reduced functional connections between brain circuit elements. Cultured neurons from Ts21 fetuses and from fetuses of an animal model for DS, the trisomy 16 (Ts16) mouse, do not differ from controls with regard to passive electrical membrane properties, including resting potential and membrane resistance. On the other hand, the trisomic neurons demonstrate abnormal active electrical and biochemical properties (duration of action potential and its rates of depolarization and repolarization, altered kinetics of active Na+, Ca2+ and K+ currents, altered membrane densities of Na+ and Ca2+ channels). Another animal model, the adult segmental trisomy 16 mouse (Ts65Dn), demonstrates reduced long-term potentiation and increased long-term depression (models for learning and memory related to synaptic plasticity) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Evidence suggests that the abnormalities in the trisomy mouse models are related to defective signal transduction pathways involving the phosphoinositide cycle, protein kinase A and protein kinase C. The phenotypes of DS and its mouse models do not involve abnormal gene products due to mutations or deletions, but result from altered expression of genes on human chromosome 21 or mouse chromosome 16, respectively. To the extent that the defects in signal transduction and in active electrical properties, including synaptic plasticity, that are found in the Ts16 and Ts65Dn mouse models, are found in the brain of DS subjects, we postulate that mental retardation in DS results from such abnormalities. Changes in timing and synaptic interaction between neurons during development can lead to less than optimal functioning of neural circuitry and signaling then and in later life.

TI  - Chronic traumatic encephalopathy and athletes
T2  - NEUROLOGY
AB  - Recent case reports have described athletes previously exposed to repetitive head trauma while participating in contact sports who later in life developed mood disorders, headaches, cognitive difficulties, suicidal ideation, difficulties with speech, and aggressive behavior. Postmortem discoveries show that some of these athletes have pathologic findings that are collectively termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Current hypotheses suggest that concussions or perhaps blows to the head that do not cause the signs and symptoms necessary for making the diagnosis of concussion, so-called subconcussive blows, cause both the clinical and pathologic findings. There are, however, some athletes who participate in contact sports who do not develop the findings ascribed to CTE. Furthermore, there are people who have headaches, mood disorders, cognitive difficulties, suicidal ideation, and other clinical problems who have neither been exposed to repeated head trauma nor possessed the pathologic postmortem findings of those currently diagnosed with CTE. The current lack of prospective data and properly designed case-control studies limits the current understanding of CTE, leading to debate about the causes of the neuropathologic findings and the clinical observations. Given the potential for referral and recall bias in available studies, it remains unclear whether or not the pathologic findings made postmortem cause the presumed neurobehavioral sequela and whether the presumed risk factors, such as sports activity, cerebral concussions, and subconcussive blows, are solely causative of the clinical signs and symptoms. This article discusses the current evidence and the associated limitations.

TI  - Toward Coordinate-based Cognition Dictionaries: A BrainMap and Neurosynth Demo
T2  - NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Characterizing the functional involvement of specific brain regions has long been a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques have offered solutions for mapping functional neural networks. The complex nature of structure-function correspondence makes an elaborate task design difficult to fully capture higher-order cognitive function. Other research practices, such as brainbehavior association or between-group comparisons, are thus widely used to explore cognitive correlations with specific brain regions. However, interpreting the results derived from a specific brain region with their underlying cognitive functions has been too general in publications. Here, we use two examples, i.e., a brain-intelligence correlation study and a depression-control comparison meta-study, to demonstrate use of two neuroimaging online databases, BrainMap and Neurosynth. One key utility of the two databases is collecting results from massive cognitive task-based fMRI (tb-fMRI) studies, i.e., coordinates in standard brain space. Just like looking up a "coordinate-based cognition dictionary", researchers can receive a plethora of related tb-fMRI activation information characterized by cognitive domains, specific cognitive functions, cognitive task paradigms, and related publications. Surprisingly, we found that only less than 1% of brain-behavior association or between-group comparison studies have utilized this dictionary approach. We encourage the community to further engage with the existing databases for specific and comprehensive interpretation of neuroimaging as well as guidance of future experimental tb-fMRI design.(c) 2022 IBRO.
