AB  -  Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary state between normal aging and dementia. It has a high risk of progression in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non‐invasive brain stimulation technique used to improve cognitive deficits in patients with MCI and AD. Although previous meta‐analyses included studies carried on patients with MCI and AD, few studies have analyzed patients with MCI independently. This meta‐analysis aimed to evaluate the effects and safety of rTMS on cognition function in patients with MCI and factors that may influence such effects. Methods: Data used in this study were searched and screened from different databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP), Wanfang Database, and China BioMedical Literature Database (SinoMed). The retrieved studies were carefully reviewed, data were extracted, and the quality of data was assessed. Results: A total of 12 studies involving 329 patients with MCI were included in the present meta‐analysis. The analyses results revealed that rTMS improved cognitive function [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.44‐1.22, p = 0.0009] and memory function (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.48‐0.97, p < 0.00001) in the MCI + rTMS active group when compared to the sham stimulation group. The showed that: (1) cognitive improvement was more pronounced under high‐frequency rTMS stimulation of multiple sites, such as the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and (2) more than 10 rTMS stimulation sessions produced higher improvement on cognition function in patients with MCI. Conclusions: This study shows that rTMS can improve cognitive function in patients with MCI, especially when applied at high frequency, multi‐site, and for a prolonged period. However, further studies are required to validate these findings and explore more effective stimulation protocols and targets.

AB  -  Background: Cognitive decline is one of the greatest concerns for patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and their care partners. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a nonpharmacological treatment option used to improve cognitive function in PD, but its efficacy is unclear. We performed a meta‐analysis to determine whether rTMS improves cognition in PD patients. Methods: Eligibility criteria (PICOS) were as follows: (1) ‘P’: The patients participating were diagnosed with idiopathic PD; (2) ‘I’: Intervention using rTMS; (3) ‘C’: Sham stimulation as control; (4) ‘O’: The outcome of the study included cognitive evaluations; (5) ‘S’: The study adopted randomized controlled design. The standardized mean difference (SMD) of change of score was applied to measure efficacy, and we used Version 2 of the Cochrane tool to assess risk of bias. Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Compared with sham‐controlled group, the pooled result showed a non‐significant short‐term effect of rTMS on global cognition (SMD: −0.15, 95% CI: −0.59 to 0.29, I 2 = 36.7%), executive function (SMD: 0.03, 95% CI: −0.21 to 0.26, I 2 = 0.0%), and attention and working memory (SMD: 0.05, 95% CI: −0.25 to 0.35, I 2 = 0.0%). Long‐term outcomes were either shown to be statistically nonsignificant. Conclusions: Based on a limited number of studies, rTMS fails to improve cognition in PD. We call for additional high‐quality randomized controlled trials with adequate sample sizes to determine the efficacy of rTMS.

AB  -  AIM: This meta‐analysis aimed to assess the effect of high‐frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF‐rTMS) for the treatment of depression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: The design was a meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The participants were patients with PD who suffered from depression. The interventions were HF‐rTMS alone or in combination with other treatments compared with sham‐rTMS, placebo, and anti‐depressant treatments. The primary outcome measure was changes in depressive symptoms, defined as the mean change in the total depression score. The secondary outcome was changes in motor symptoms, defined by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III scores, and the acceptability, defined as the risk of all‐cause discontinuation. These were expressed as mean differences (MDs), standardized mean differences (SMDs), or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We identified nine suitable trials, with data from 332 participants. For the patients with depression in PD, HF‐rTMS was not better than sham‐rTMS (SMD =‐0.33, 95% CI ‐0.83 to 0.17) or selective serotonin re‐uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (SMD =0.07, 95% CI ‐0.52 to 0.18) for the treatment of depressive symptoms. However, the motor benefits after treatment with HF‐rTMS might be better than sham‐rTMS (MD =‐2.80, 95% CI ‐5.45 to ‐0.15) and SSRIs (MD =‐2.70, 95% CI ‐4.51 to ‐0.90). CONCLUSION: This meta‐analysis provides some evidence that in patients with PD with depression, HF‐rTMS may lead to improvement in motor function but not in depression compared with sham‐rTMS or SSRIs.

AB  -  Objective: To explore the effects of quadripulse stimulation (QPS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) in the healthy humans. Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been applied as a treatment of various neurologic diseases. In Parkinson disease (PD), some meta‐analysis indicated that rTMS over the primary motor cortex (M1) or SMA improve motor symptoms. Both high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) rTMS improve the PD symptoms, but the effect of rTMS is highly variable among individuals. The interindividual variability of QPS was reported to be lower compared with other rTMS protocols, offering a potential of therapeutic use of QPS in PD. However, it is unclear whether QPS over SMA could indeed induce cortical excitability changes. Based on these, we assessed the effect of QPS over SMA in healthy individuals. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers (8 men, 2 women, mean age 28.9 ± 5.2 years) participated in this experiment. We evaluated motor‐evoked potentials (MEPs), short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) before and after QPS over left SMA. MEPs were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle at rest. TMS pulse was set at intensity of 90% active motor threshold (AMT) for FDI. Interstimulus interval (ISI) was 5 or 50ms (QPS‐5 or 50). Sham stimulation was performed as placebo. Participants received all rTMS patterns (QPS‐5, QPS‐50, and Sham stimulation) in random order at an interval of at least one week (washout time). Results: QPS‐50 induced MEP size reduction for 30min after the intervention. In contrast, neither QPS‐5 nor sham stimulation induced any significant MEP changes. Neither SICI nor ICF was affected by any QPS interventions. Conclusions: We, here, showed QPS over SMA induced heterotopic LTD like plasticity in the primary motor cortex (M1). In contrast, QPS over M1 induced bi‐directional, homotopic plasticity in M1. The present results suggest that we should not simply extrapolate the results of rTMS over M1 to other cortical areas.

AB  -  Background: Previous review reported that the high‐frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the primary motor area (M1) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients could alleviate their symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the effect of rTMS over the left M1 of patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). Methods: Fifteen MSA patients were randomly assigned to receive a 10‐session real (EP: group of experimental patients; n=7) or sham (CP: group of control patients; n=8) rTMS stimulation over two weeks. The overall experimental procedure consisted of two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions, before and after a 10‐session rTMS treatment. A complex self‐paced sequential tapping task was performed during fMRI scanning. In addition, 18 age and gender matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Subjects from the HC group did not receive any rTMS treatment and they underwent fMRI examination only once. The primary end point was the motor score change of the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS‐II) measured before and after the 5th and 10th session. Task‐related activation was also compared among groups. Results: After active rTMS treatment, only patients of EP group significant improvement in UMSARS‐II score. Compared to HC, MSA patients showed significant activation over similar brain areas except for the cerebellum. Increased activation was obtained in the bilateral cerebellum after rTMS treatment in the EP group. On the contrary, no increased activation was identified in the CP group. Conclusions: Our results highlight rTMS over M1 induced motor improvement in MSA patients that may be associated with increased activation in the cerebellum.

AB  -  Background and purpose: Poststroke urinary incontinence (PSI) is prevalent in stroke survivors, and high‐quality evidence is required to guide clinical practice. Previous studies have demonstrated the curative effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for urinary incontinence in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson��s disease (PD), and spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we describe the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low‐frequency rTMS on the contralesional primary motor cortex (M1) for the treatment of PSI. Methods and analysis: In this single‐centre randomized controlled trial for poststroke urinary incontinence, a total of 140 eligible patients will be randomly allocated into two groups. The rTMS group (n = 70) will receive low‐frequency rTMS at the M1 along with routine medical care, while the control group will receive sham rTMS along with routine medical care. All participants will undergo 20 treatment sessions, five times a week for 4 weeks. The primary outcome measures will be the changes in the urodynamic test at baseline versus 4 weeks after intervention. The secondary outcomes include the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ‐UI SF), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS), and pelvic floor muscle function. Ethics and dissemination: The Institutional Review Board and Hospital Research Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University approved this trial, and the approval number is No. 2020‐153. All methods will be carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and relevant ethical guidelines covering informed consent, confidentiality, and data storage. After the study had been thoroughly described to the participants by a physician, all participants will provide written informed consent indicating their willingness to participate. The results will be disseminated to most of the population, including participants, researchers, healthcare providers, and sponsors.

AB  -  INTRODUCTION: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) has an increasing prevalence worldwide, accounting for at least 20%‐40% of all diagnoses of dementia. The decline in cognitive function seriously impairs patients' activities of daily living and social participation and reduces their quality of life. However, there is still a lack of advanced, definitive rehabilitation programmes for VCI. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are recognised treatments for improving cognitive impairment. The former can restore oxygen supply in the brain by increasing oxygen partial pressure in brain tissue, while the latter can enhance neuronal excitability and promote synaptic plasticity. However, no studies have explored the effect of HBO combined with rTMS on VCI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is designed as a single‐centre, assessor‐blind, randomised controlled clinical trial with four parallel arms. A total of 72 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to the control group, HBOT group, rTMS group and HBOT combined with rTMS group at a ratio of 1:1:1:1. All enrolled participants will receive conventional treatment. The entire intervention period is 4 weeks, with a 3‐week follow‐up. Outcomes will be measured at baseline (T0), after a 4‐week intervention (T1) and after an additional 3‐week follow‐up period (T2). The primary endpoint is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score. The secondary endpoints are Mini‐Mental State Examination score, Modified Barthel Index score, latency and amplitude of P300, cerebral cortical oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxygenated haemoglobin (HbR) concentrations as measured by task‐state functional near‐infrared spectroscopy. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the West China Hospital Clinical Trials and Biomedical Ethics Committee of Sichuan University (ethics reference: 2022 (1972)). The findings will be published in peer‐reviewed journals and disseminated through scientific conferences and seminars. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2300068242.

AB  -  Introduction: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often exhibit difficulties with dexterity during the performance of activities of daily living (ADL) due to dysfunctional supplementary motor area (SMA). The aim of this clinical trial protocol work is to describe how the effectiveness of a combined repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over SMA and video‐game‐based skill training (VBT) in PD will be evaluated. The short and long‐term benefits are assessed. Methods and analysis: A single‐blind (patients) stratified (based on Hoehn & Yahr) parallel randomized sham‐controlled rTMS‐VBT study with a baseline and two follow‐up measurements (3 and 12 weeks) is being conducted. These measurements include the dexterity questionnaire 24 (DextQ‐24) as a primary outcome, and nine hole peg test and coin rotation task as main secondary dexterity outcomes. Further secondary outcomes will be the subscale II of the movement disorders society unified PD rating scale (MDS‐UPDRS) to assess improvements on overall ADL and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire‐39 to assess quality of life. Thirty‐six outpatients (from one neurorehabilitation center) with PD (diagnosis based on brain bank criteria) will be recruited who report difficulties with dexterity in performing ADL. All PD patients will receive a 45‐min VBT three times a week for 3 weeks. The PD patients randomized in the experimental group will receive VBT preceded by real rTMS, being intermittent theta burst (iTBS) stimulation sessions. The PD patients randomized to the control group receive a VBT with sham rTMS. Discussion: The study will provide evidence to determine whether a combined iTBS and VBT skill intervention is more effective than a VBT intervention alone to improve dexterity in PD. Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Northwest and Central Switzerland (EKNZ), Switzerland 2019‐00433. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice. Informed consent will be signed prior to subject enrolment. Dissemination will include submission to international peer‐reviewed professional journals and presentation at international congresses. The study protocol has been registered in the clinicaltrials.gov registry with the identification code: NCT04699149.

AB  -  INTRODUCTION: Early decline of episodic memory is detectable in subjective cognitive decline (SCD). The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is associated with encoding episodic memories. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel and viable tool to improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment, but the treatment effect in SCD has not been studied. We aim to investigate the efficacy of rTMS on episodic memory in individuals with SCD, and to explore the potential mechanisms of neural plasticity. METHODS: In our randomized, sham‐controlled trial, patients (n = 60) with SCD will receive 20 sessions (5 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks) of real rTMS (n = 30) or sham rTMS (n = 30) over the left DLPFC. The primary outcome is the Auditory Verbal Learning Test‐Huashan version (AVLT‐H). Other neuropsychological examinations and the long‐term potentiation (LTP)‐like cortical plasticity evaluation serve as the secondary outcomes. These outcomes will be assessed before and at the end of the intervention. DISCUSSION: If the episodic memory of SCD improve after the intervention, the study will confirm that rTMS is a promising intervention for cognitive function improvement on the early stage of dementia. This study will also provide important clinical evidence for early intervention in AD and emphasizes the significance that impaired LTP‐like cortical plasticity may be a potential biomarker of AD prognosis by demonstrating the predictive role of LTP on cognitive improvement in SCD. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the hospital (No. 2023‐002‐01). The results will be published in peer‐review publications.

AB  -  Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have some problem with self‐initiated movement task. Compared with health controls, task meta‐analysis found that PD patients showed abnormal activation in pre‐supplementary motor area (pre‐SMA) and putamen. And the functional connectivity has already been reported between pre‐SMA and putamen in 2013. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a sage and painless technique to activate cortical areas. The deep brain structure can be activated via stimulating superficial cortex by rTMS. For investigating the mechanism of self‐initiated movement, this project is using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to individualize the precise localization in motor area and combining rTMS to activate putamen.

AB  -  Cancer‐related cognitive impairment (CRCI) refers to a series of cognitive impairment symptoms associated with alternations in brain structure and function, caused by a non‐central nervous system malignant tumor and its related treatment. CRCI may present as memory loss, impaired concentration, difficulty in multitasking and word retrieval, and reduced comprehension speed. CRCI has become one of the prevalent factors that compromise the quality of life for cancer survivors. Different treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted drugs, may contribute to CRCI. Meanwhile, patients' factors, including emotional challenges and genetic makeup, also contribute to the development of CRCI. The condition can be treated with using stimulants methylphenidate and modafinil, metabolites of nicotine: Cotinine, antidepressants of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, dementia drug of donepezil, and antioxidants ZnSO4, n‐acetyl cysteine, propofol, and Chinese herbal of silver leaf medicine. Psychotherapies, including meditation and relaxation, cognitive rehabilitation training, along with physical therapies, including aerobic exercise, resistance training, balance training, yoga, qigong, tai chi electroencephalogram biofeedback, and acupuncture, are also beneficial in alleviating cancer‐related cognitive impairment symptoms. In recent years, researchers have focused on factors related to the condition and on the available interventions. However, most research was conducted independently, and no review has yet summarized the latest findings. This review details and discusses the status of related factors and potential treatments for CRCI. We also supply specific recommendations to facilitate future research and integration in this field.

AB  -  Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by sudden and brief episodes of inability to produce effective forward stepping. FOG is a major risk factor for falls, and greatly contributes to reduced mobility and quality of daily life. Treatment of FOG has been perceived as a very challenging task. Although various treatment approaches exist, including pharmacological and surgical options, evidence is inconclusive for many approaches and no clear treatment protocols are available until now. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive neural modulation technique, has been closely applied as a treatment for various neurologic and psychiatric disorders. A recent meta‐analysis demonstrated that rTMS could improve motor symptoms for PD patients with a moderate effect size. To date, however, only few rTMS studies have focused on its efficacy on FOG in patients with parkinsonism, and most of them targeted the primary motor cortex or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . Even though some evidence indicates the involvement of the SMA in FOG, no report has described the SMA rTMS in PD patients with FOG. Moreover, few studies combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and rTMS to unravel the mechanism of its beneficial effects. To address these issues, the investigators conducted a randomized, double‐blind, sham‐controlled study to explore the efficiency of SMA‐rTMS on FOG in PD patients.

AB  -  Many studies have examined aspects of balance in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), but guidance on the feasibility of standardized objective balance assessments and balance scales in PSP is lacking. Balance tests commonly used in Parkinson's disease often cannot be easily administered or translated to PSP. Here we briefly review methodology in prior studies of balance in PSP; then we focus on feasibility by presenting our experience with objective balance assessment in PSP‐Richardson syndrome and PSP‐parkinsonism during a crossover rTMS intervention trial. We highlight lessons learned, safety considerations, and future approaches for objective balance assessment in PSP.

AB  -  Background.  Initially developed to excite peripheral nerves, magnetic stimulation was quickly recognized as a valuable tool to noninvasively activate the cerebral cortex. The subsequent discovery that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could have long‐lasting effects on cortical excitability spawned a broad interest in the use of this technique as a new therapeutic method in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the current outcomes from initial trials include some conflicting results, initial evidence supports that rTMS might have a therapeutic value in different neurologic conditions. Methods.  We reviewed the results of clinical trials of rTMS on four different disorders: stroke, Parkinson's disease, chronic refractory pain, and epilepsy. We reviewed randomized, controlled studies only in order to obtain the strongest evidence for the clinical effects of rTMS. Results.  An extensive literature review revealed 32 articles that met our criteria. From these studies, we found evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS, particularly in the relief of chronic pain and motor neurorehabilitation in single hemisphere stroke patients. Repetitive TMS also seems to have a therapeutic effect on motor function in Parkinson's disease, but the evidence is somewhat confounded by the uncontrolled variability of multiple factors. Lastly, only two randomized, sham‐controlled studies have been performed for epilepsy; although evidence indicates rTMS may reduce seizure frequency in patients with neocortical foci, more research is needed to confirm these initial findings. Conclusions.  There is mounting evidence for the efficacy of rTMS in the short‐term treatment of certain neurologic conditions. More long‐term research is needed in order to properly evaluate the effects of this method in a clinical setting.

AB  -  Recent studies have reported enhanced performance on language tasks induced by non‐invasive brain stimulation, i.e., repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), or transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), in patients with aphasia due to stroke or Alzheimer's disease (AD). The first part of this article reviews brain stimulation studies related to language recovery in aphasic patients. The second part reports results from a pilot study with three chronic stroke patients who had non‐fluent aphasia, where real or placebo rTMS was immediately followed by 25 minutes of individualised speech therapy. Real rTMS consisted of high‐frequency rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 8/9) for 25 minutes. Each patient underwent a total of four weeks of intervention. P1 underwent four weeks of real rTMS (5 days/week) where individualised speech therapy was provided for 25 minutes immediately following each rTMS session. P2 and P3 each underwent two weeks of placebo rTMS, followed immediately by individualised speech therapy; then two weeks of real rTMS, followed immediately by individualised speech therapy. Assessments took place at 2, 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks post‐entry/baseline testing. Relative to entry/baseline testing, a significant improvement in object naming was observed at all testing times, from two weeks post‐intervention in real rTMS plus speech therapy, or placebo rTMS plus speech therapy. Our findings suggest beneficial effects of targeted behavioural training in combination with brain stimulation in chronic aphasic patients. However, further work is required in order to verify whether optimal combination parameters (rTMS alone or speech therapy alone) and length of rTMS treatment may be found.

AB  -  Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by a broad spectrum of motor and non‐motor symptoms. Objective: To investigate the modulatory effects of repetetive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on motor symptoms in Parkinsons Disease (PD). Patients and Methods / Material and Methods: rTMS was given over three cortical areas principally implicated in PD‐motor area (MA): Group 1, pre‐motor area (PMA): Group 2 and supplementary motor area (SMA): Group 3. After obtaining approval from Institutional Review Board (IRB) and informed written consent from all patients, in this single blind, cross over, sham‐controlled study; subjects (H & Y up to 2.5) were randomized to three groups. 3000 pulses were delivered at 1Hz (Group 1&2) and 5Hz (Group 3). The outcomes (UPDRS, PDQ 39, HAM‐A, HAM‐D) were assessed at 0, 4 and 8 weeks. Results: Improvements in scores of UPDRS II (p< 0.01) ; UPDRS III (p< 0.01); UPDRS Total (p< 0.01); Mobility (p< 0.01); ADL (p< 0.01); Bodily Discomfort (p=0.031) were observed in Group1 compared to sham. Improvements in scores of UPDRS II (p<0.01); UPDRS III (p< 0.01) UPDRS Total (p < 0.01); Mobility (p< 0.01); ADL (p< 0.01); Cognition (p=0.01); Communication (p=0.002); Bodily Discomfort (p=0.031) were seen in Group3 compared to sham. All other domains in any of the three groups did not show any appreciable change compared to sham. Conclusion: Results suggest that rTMS over MA(1Hz) and SMA (5 Hz) potentially alleviate motor symptoms in patients with PD. The efficacy of rTMS on PD merits exploration with larger sample sizes and longer terms of follow‐up.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: A recent well‐conducted meta‐analysis showed that placebo effect is associated with a possible small benefit for subjective outcomes, but has no significant effects on objective outcomes. Objective: Herein, we aimed to investigate the immediate effects of two different types of placebo [placebo pill and sham transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)] in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and compared them to the standard treatment (levodopa) in a proper randomized, double‐blind, crossover clinical trial. METHODS: PD patients received three different interventions on different days: levodopa, placebo pill, and sham TMS. The motor function was assessed using simple and choice reaction time, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), finger tapping, Purdue Pegboard test, time to button up, walking time and supination‐pronation. The subjective motor function was measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: The results showed that there was a significant motor function in the motor function only after the treatment with levodopa, but not after treatment with placebo pills or sham TMS. However, patients reported a similar subjective improvement in motor function indexed by VAS following these three treatments. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that placebo interventions in PD may have an immediate subjective sensation of improvement but result in no significant objective motor changes compared with levodopa treatment. Although physiological changes are possible after a placebo intervention, our findings suggest that the acute placebo effect in PD may be the result of the subjective change in the motor rating only.

AB  -  Frontotemporal dementia is more frequently diagnosed because of revised diagnostic procedures. Due to the lack of pharmacological trials it is a disease that is difficult to manage in the way of evidence based medicine. Deficits in serotonergic and dopaminergic signal‐transmission are well known. The cholinergic system does not seem to be affected. Case reports and clinical trials show a benefit by using antidepressants, neuroleptics and mood stabilizers. Nevertheless only paroxetine, trazodone and rivastigmine are tested by double‐blind, placebo‐controlled studies. While paroxetine shows inconsistent data, trazodone improves behavioural symptoms. Patients report a treatment‐emergent adverse effect including fatigue, dizziness and hypotension. Rivastigmine leads to a significant decrease in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Score. Finally, we present a two‐cases‐report that shows improve of disease symptoms under treatment with repetitive transcranial magnet stimulation.

AB  -  Background: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a technique based on the principles of electromagnetic induction. It applies pulses of magnetic radiation that penetrate the brain tissue, and it is a non‐invasive, painless, and practically innocuous procedure. Previous studies advocate the therapeutic capacity of TMS in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric processes, both in animal models and in human studies. Its uses in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and in Huntington's chorea have shown improvement in the symptomatology and in the molecular profile, and even in the cellular density of the brain. Consequently, the extrapolation of these TMS results in the aforementioned neurodegenerative disease to other entities with etiopathogenic and clinical analogy would raise the relevance and feasibility of its use in multiple sclerosis (MS). The overall objective will be to demonstrate the effectiveness of the TMS in terms of safety and clinical improvement, as well as to observe the molecular changes in relation to the treatment. Methods and Design: Phase II clinical trial, unicentric, controlled, randomized, single blind. A total of 90 patients diagnosed with relapsing‐remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who meet all the inclusion criteria and do not present any of the exclusion criteria that are established and from which clinically evaluable results can be obtained. The patients included will be assigned under the 1:1:1 randomization formula, constituting three groups for the present study: 30 patients treated with natalizumab + white (placebo) + 30 patients treated with natalizumab + TMS (1 Hz) + 30 patients treated with natalizumab + TMS (5 Hz). Discussion: Results of this study will inform on the efficiency of the TMS for the treatment of MS. The expected results are that TMS is a useful therapeutic resource to improve clinical status (main parameters) and neurochemical profile (surrogate parameters); both types of parameters will be checked. Ethics and Dissemination: The study is approved by the Local Ethics Committee and registered in https://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04062331). Dissemination will include submission to a peer‐reviewed journal, patients, associations of sick people and family members, healthcare magazines and congress presentations. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04062331 (registration date: 19th/ August/2019). Version Identifier: EMTr‐EMRR, ver‐3, 21/11/2017.

AB  -  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of a new patterned theta burst stimulation algorithm of DBS with the aim of expanding the therapeutic window and clinical benefit in PD. METHODS: In this single‐center, randomized, double‐blind, clinical short‐term trial, unilateral conventional subthalamic DBS was compared with unilateral patterned stimulation algorithms with intraburst high‐ or low‐frequency theta burst stimulation in 17 PD patients. RESULTS: There were no serious adverse events with theta burst stimulation. During monopolar review, conventional subthalamic DBS and high‐frequency theta burst stimulation were comparable, but low‐frequency theta burst stimulation differed by requiring higher stimulation amplitudes for symptom reduction, but a larger therapeutic window. High‐ and low‐frequency theta burst stimulation with adapted stimulation amplitude were effective in PD symptom reduction with differential effects on akinesia and tremor, depending on the theta burst stimulation mode. CONCLUSIONS: Theta burst stimulation is a safe and effective stimulation mode with potential future application opportunities. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

AB  -  TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSION USING TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION Rationale: Depression and tDCS Major depression is a disorder with major clinical and economic significance locally and internationally. It is a disorder of high prevalence and results in substantial disease burden and health‐care costs. Critically, a significant percentage of patients, usually estimated at around 30%, fail to respond to standard treatments (Fitzgerald 2003). Techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are being investigated widely for the treatment of this disorder with considerable success in recent years (Fitzgerald, Benitez et al. 2006)(Hasey 2001). However, TMS equipment is expensive and requires specialist application. Additionally, TMS is associated with some side‐effects. Given that depression occurs in all cultures and countries, there would be considerable value in developing a low‐cost, non‐invasive technique that can be applied in a wide variety of settings, including in the Third World. RTMS based treatments for depression are based on an understanding that there are abnormalities in activity in frontal brain regions in this disorder (George, Ketter et al. 1994; Fitzgerald, Brown et al. 2003; Speer, Kimbrell et al. 2000). High‐frequency stimulation which increases brain activity is usually applied to the left prefrontal cortex in a way that increases activity, although previous literature is somewhat inconsistent. In contrast, low‐frequency stimulation which decreases brain activity is applied to the right prefrontal cortex to reduce activity in this region. Both these techniques have therapeutic efficacy (Fitzgerald, Brown et al. 2003). Recent studies, including those conducted by this research group, suggest that a combination of these two approaches is also effective; potentially more effective than either one used independently (Garcia‐Toro, Salva et al. 2006; Fitzgerald, 2006). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel, non‐invasive and non‐convulsive technique for altering brain function (Ardolino, Bossi et al. 2005). It involves the application of a small current (usually 1 to 2 mA) between an anodal and cathodal electrode placed on the scalp (Miranda, Lomarev et al. 2006). Typically, an increase in neuronal excitability occurs under the anode, and a decrease under the cathode, probably through respective depolarisation and hyperpolarisation of neurons (Miranda, Lomarev et al. 2006). It has been shown to be safe in a number of experimental and clinical trials (Fregni, Boggio et al. 2005; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2005; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006; Nitsche, Liebetanz et al. 2003; Lang, Nitsche et al. 2004; Boggio, Castro et al. 2006). Both of these two studies in depression have used anodal stimulation applied to the left prefrontal cortex. The cathode was placed in a position over the left eye and was proposed not to have contributed to the antidepressant efficacy of the stimulation. We propose a slightly different protocol involving anodal stimulation to the left prefrontal cortex and the placement of the cathode over the right prefrontal cortex. This should ensure activating stimulation on the left and deactivating stimulation on the right quite similar to the sequential bilateral rTMS techniques that we have been testing. There is no reason to presume that this should be associated with any greater rate of side‐effects, but may enhance therapeutic efficacy. 2. Sham treatment: the system will be set up as for condition one but the stimulated will be turned off after 30 seconds. ‐ Hypothesis 1: Active tDCS will improve depressive symptomology to a significantly greater degree than sham treatment. ‐ Hypothesis 2: Active tDCS will be well tolerated and free of major side effects. Most of the research with tDCS has investigated its use in modifying cognitive functions in experimental neuropsychology. However there is an increasing use of this technique in therapeutic trials for disorders such as chronic pain, tinnitus and motor impairment post‐stroke (Fregni, Boggio et al. 2005; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006). Research has also begun on tDCS in the treatment of depression (Nitsche 2002; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006). In the first of these studies patients were randomised to active or sham stimulation (Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006). Anodal stimulation was applied to the left prefrontal cortex. This resulted in statistically significant improvement in depressive symtomology, relative to the sham condition. As the sensation produced by tDCS usually disappears completely after 30 seconds, the sham used in this study involves turning the device on for 30 seconds and then turning it off. A second study by the same group including 30 patients has been submitted for publication. It also shows statistically significant antidepressant effects on the active treatment group, relative to sham stimulation. Importantly, no substantial side‐effects have been reported in either of these two clinical trials (Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006). General Study Design: The proposed study will be a randomized, double blind, placebo‐controlled (i.e., sham tDCS), longitudinal, treatment outcome trial. Individuals with depression will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment conditions. These will be: 1. Active 2mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): in this condition, 1 stimulator will be used with anodal stimulation to the left prefrontal cortex and cathodal stimulation to the right prefrontal cortex. The placement of anodal stimulation is proposed to enhance activity in the left frontal cortex; and the cathode aims to reduce activity in the right prefrontal cortex. A total of 15 treatments will be administered to all participants over 3 weeks (one per working day). Individuals will be randomized on a computer‐generated list with the information stored on a central computer such that only the treating physician will be aware of the treatment allocation of the patients. It is anticipated that stratified randomization of the sample according to potentially clinically significant variables such as age, sex, illness and treatment duration would dramatically increase the required sample size and is beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, we have chosen not to do so. Nonetheless, based on descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression will be performed to adjust for significant clinical predictors. Clinical raters and patients will be blind to the treatment condition. The following primary hypotheses will be tested. Subjects: 50 patients with depression will be recruited to participate in the study. Symptoms: Symptoms of depression will be assesed with the 17‐item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). Other outcome measures will include the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck Depression Questionnaire (BDI), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and an interview to record the subjective experiences of tDCS and any adverse events. ‐ Participants will be included if they: (1) Are competent to consent; (2) have a diagnosis of Major Depression and are currently experiencing a Major Depressive Episode as confirmed by the Structure Clinical Interview for the DSM‐IV (SCID‐IV); (3) are treatment resistant, defined as a failure to achieve a clinical response, or an inability to tolerate, an antidepressant trial of sufficient dose for at least 6 weeks; and (4) are between the ages of 18 and 75. Concomitant medications including: (1) benzodiazepines, (2) mood stabilizers (lithium, valproic acid) (3) antidepressants (including serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) and anticholinergics will be allowed. Since carbamazepine has been shown to interfere with the effects of anodal tDCS, potential participants taking it will not be suitable for inclusion in the trial. ‐ Patients will be excluded if they: (1) Have a DSM‐IV history of substance abuse or dependence in the last 6 months; (2) Have a concomitant major and unstable medical or neurologic illness; (4) are currently taking carbamazepine; or, (3) are pregnant. ‐ Finally, patients will be withdrawn from the study if they: (1) withdraw consent; (2) experience significant clinical deterioration; (3) fail to tolerate the procedure; or, (4) develop a serious adverse event. In the event that a patient is withdrawn or drops out of the study, efforts will be made to obtain a final set of clinical, cognitive and neurophysiological measures at the time of withdrawal for a last observation carried forward analysis. Transcranial direct current stimulation: Site, Intensity and Frequency: Direct current will be transferred with a pair of saline soaked sponge electrodes (contact area 5 x 7cm), and delivered by a specially developed, battery driven constant current stimulator. The electrodes will be placed over F3 and F4 according to the 10‐20 international system for EEG placement. This has been shown to be a relatively accurate method of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) localisation by neuronavigation methods (Herwig, Padberg et al. 2001), and has been used before in tDCS studies targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Fregni, Boggio et al. 2005; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006). Safety: tDCS has previously been used in multiple studies in areas such as post‐stroke rehabilitation, Parkinson's disease and depression, with no adverse sequelae noted (Fregni, Boggio et al. 2005; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2005; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006; Fregni, Boggio et al. 2006)(Nitsche, Liebetanz et al. 2003; Lang, Nitsche et al. 2004; Boggio, Castro et al. 2006). The procedure produces a mild tingling sensation initially which has usually completely resolved within 30 seconds. Sham Condition: Sham stimulation will be made using the same stimulation parameters and at the site of active treatment, but the current will be turned off after 30 seconds. Typically, tDCS induces an itching or tingling sensation for the first 30 seconds of its application, which then fades, making this an appropriate method for blinding. Course: The primary study will be 3 weeks in duration. Therefore, participants will receive 15 treatments lasting twenty minutes, conducted daily on week days. Patients will be assessed at baseline and 3 weeks and with an abbreviated assessment after the first 7 days of treatment (MADRS only). Patients in the sham group will be offered open label active treatment at the end. Patients who have responded to tDCS will also be followed up post treatment with assessments at up to monthly intervals where possible to assess duration of response. Patients who have achieved a significant response to tDCS may be offered a 'repeat' treatment if requested following symptomatic relapse. Cognition: The primary outcome measures will be performance on the forwards and backwards digit span (assessment of verbal working memory) and block spatial span (spatial working memory) tests. In addition, other aspects of prefrontal cognitive functioning will be assessed using the N‐back task, Tower of London planning task, FAS verbal fluency task and the trail making task (A &B). These additional task are included to assess whether treatment with rTMS results in specific changes to working memory or broader domains of prefrontal cognitive functioning. In addition, baseline assessment of premorbid intellectual functioning will be conducted using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ‐ 3rd edition (WAIS‐III). Electroencephalography: Where possible (based on laboratory availability) EEG will be recorded before and after tDCS to assess the effect of tDCS on alpha, beta, delta, theta and gamma power bands using a standard 64 channel Neuroscan EEG system used in many studies by our group. Analysis We will use a series of repeated measures ANOVA models to assess change in depressive and cogntive symptoms over time between the groups. There is no data on which to base a smaple size calculation: we have planned a larger sample than that used in most rTMS and tDCS trials and will conduct an interim analysis after the recruitment of 20 patients to re‐estimate the sample size. THE TREATMENT OF WORKING MEMORY AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WITH TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION Rationale: Schizophrenia and tDCS Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a debilitating disease which affects approximately 1% of the population. Measured only in an economic sense, the cost to the Australian government is estimated at 2.25 billion Australian dollars per annum [1]. A significant proportion of the burden carried by individuals with schizophrenia stems from negative symptoms such as social withdrawal and impaired executive functioning. Current treatments for schizophrenia, including new atypical antipsychotic agents, while effective in treating some positive symptoms of schizophrenia, have demonstrated only limited efficacy in treating negative symptoms. There is a need for a new therapeutic option for people with schizophrenia which can treat these aspects of their illness. Negative symptoms, prefrontal cortex and short term memory A number of studies have found an association between negative symptoms including blunted affect and executive functioning cognitive deficits and reduced activation in prefrontal areas, particularly the left prefrontal cortex. [8‐14]. Biltaeral dorsolateral left prefrontal cortex dysfunction has been associated with short term memory deficits in schizophrenia [15]. Application of tDCS to the left prefrontal cortex has been shown to improve short term memory [16]. As such, treatment with tDCS would appear to have the potential to improve short term memory deficits in individuals with schizophrenia, and it also may have a positive impact on their negative symptom. General Study Design: The proposed study will be a randomized, double blind, placebo‐controlled (i.e., sham tDCS), longitudinal, treatment outcome trial. Individuals with SCZ will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment conditions. These will be: 2. Sham treatment ‐ Hypotheses 1: Bilateral tDCS will improve working memory in subjects with schizophrenia ‐ Hypothesis 2: Bilateral tDCS will reduce negative symptoms in subjects with schizophrenia. ‐ Hypothesis 3: Bilateral tDCS will reduce positive symptoms in subjects with schizophrenia. Subjects: 50 patients with SCZ will be recruited to participate in the study. Transcranial direct current stimulation: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel, non‐invasive and non‐convulsive technique for altering brain function. It involves the application of a small current (usually 1 to 2 mA) between an anodal and cathodal electrode which are placed on the scalp. Typically, an increase in neuronal excitability occurs under the anode, and a decrease under the cathode, probably through depolarisation and hyperpolarisation of neurons, respectively [2]. It has been shown to be safe in a number of experimental and clinical trials [3] and therapeutic benefits have been found in using it in the treatment of depression, pain disorders, tinnitus and motor impairment post stroke [4, 5]. In depression, one study has shown therapeutic effects compared to sham stimulation and the same group have a second positive study of 40 patients currently under review. This clearly shows antidepressant effects of tDCS greater than sham and no side effects. In fact, side effects in previous trials have been limited to a mild transient sensation of itching or tingling underneath the site of the electrodes [4]. Previous studies have shown that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) [6, 7], another technique of neuromodulation, may be effective in treating positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However TMS at the high frequencies required to increase brain activity can be physically uncomfortable due to the induction of scalp muscle twitching and is associated with potential seizure induction. tDCS is considerably cheaper than TMS, at approximately one tenth of the cost, and is associated with fewer side effect so may have a role to play in alleviating some of the disease burden for people who have schizophrenia. 1. Bilateral 2mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): in this condition, 2 stimulators will be used with anodal stimulation to the prefrontal cortex and cathodal stimulation to temporoparietal cortex (TP3 EEG site). The placement of anodal stimulation is proposed to enhance activity in bilateral frontal cortex and potentially improve negative and cognitive symptoms. Bilateral rTMS designed to reduce cortical activity appears to improve negative symptoms [17]. The cathodes, which should reduced cortical activity, are being placed over temporoparietal cortex: this site is proposed to be hyper‐active in positive symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations and possibly delusions and thought disorder [18‐22]. rTMS than reduces activity (analogous to cathodal stimulation) has been shown to reduce these symptoms, especially hallucinations (for example [1, 23, 24]). Thus, with these electrode arrangements, we anticipate the potential treatment of both positive and cognitive / negative symptoms simultaneously. This would not be possible with other brain stimulation techniques that only target one site (e.g. rTMS). ‐ Patients will be excluded if they: (1) Have a DSM‐IV history of substance abuse or dependence in the last 6 months; (2) Have a concomitant major and unstable medical or neurologic illness or have had a history of seizures; (4) are currently taking carbamazepine; or, (3) are pregnant. A total of 15 treatments will be administered to all participants over 3 weeks (one per working day). Individuals will be randomized on a computer‐generated list with the information stored on a central computer such that only the treating physician will be aware of the treatment allocation of the patients. It is anticipated that stratified randomization of the sample according to potentially clinically significant variables such as age, sex, illness and treatment duration would dramatically increase the required sample size and is beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, we have chosen not to do so. Nonetheless, based on descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression will be performed to adjust for significant clinical predictors. Clinical raters and patients will be blind to the treatment condition. The following primary hypotheses will be tested. ‐ Participants will be included if they: (1) Are voluntary and competent to consent; (2) have a diagnosis of Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder as confirmed by the Structure Clinical Interview for the DSM‐IV (SCID‐IV) (3) have persistent positive and negative symptoms despite having trialled, or being currently medicated, with antipsychotic medication; and (4) are between the ages of 18 and 65. Concomitant medications including: (1) benzodiazepines, (2) mood stabilizers (lithium, valproic acid) (3) antidepressants (including serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants) and anticholinergics will be allowed. Since carbamazepine has been shown to interfere with the effects of anodal tDCS, potential participants taking it will not be suitable for inclusion in the trial. ‐ Finally, patients will be withdrawn from the study if they: (1) withdraw consent; (2) experience significant clinical deterioration; (3) fail to tolerate the procedure; or, (4) develop a serious adverse event (e.g., seizure activity, active suicidal ideation). In the event that a patient is withdrawn or drops out of the study, efforts will be made to obtain a final set of clinical, cognitive and neurophysiological measures at the time of withdrawal for a last observation carried forward analysis. No restriction on inclusion will be made based on baseline WM performance. This will allow us to study a broad range of the spectrum of WM performance as well as the effects of tDCS on performance that is potentially normal as well as impaired. Data available for memory impairment in general suggests that 80% of patients with SCZ will perform below the median within a sample of patients and controls [25] suggesting it is likely that in an unselected sample of patients with SCZ, we are highly likely to see a significant majority with WM performance below the mean for control subjects. Safety: tDCS has previously been used in multiple studies in areas such as post‐stroke rehabilitation, Parkinson's disease and depression, with no adverse sequelae noted. [4, 5, 16, 27]. The procedure produces a mild tingling sensation initially which has usually completely resolved within 30 seconds. Sham Condition: Sham stimulation will be made using the same stimulation parameters and at the site of active treatment, but the current will be turned off after 30 seconds. Typically, tDCS induces an itching or tingling sensation for the first 30 seconds of its application, which then fades, making this an appropriate method for blinding [5]. Site, Intensity and Frequency: Direct current will be transferred with a pair of saline soaked sponge electrodes (contact area 5 x 7cm), and delivered by a specially developed, battery driven constant current stimulator. The anode electrode will be placed over F3 according to the 10‐20 international system for EEG placement. This has been shown to be a relatively accurate method of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) localisation by neuronavigation methods [26], and has been used before in tDCS studies targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [4, 16]. The cathodal electrode will be placed over the left temporal area (TP3 EEG site). Twenty minutes of 2mA stimulation will be applied in a regime previously shown to enhance working memory in a population with Parkinson's disease at a level of 2mA [4]. The same procedure will also be applied on the right side. Course: The primary study will be 3 weeks in duration. Therefore, participants will receive 15 treatments lasting twenty minutes, conducted daily on week days. Patients will be assessed at baseline and 3 weeks and with an abbreviated assessment after the first 7 days of treatment (PANSS only). Patients in the sham group will be offered open label active treatment at the end. Patients who have responded to tDCS will also be followed up post treatment with assessments at up to monthly intervals where possible to assess duration of response. Patients who have achieved a significant response to tDCS may be offered a 'repeat' treatment if requested following symptomatic relapse. Cognition: The primary outcome measures will be performance on the forwards and backwards digit span (assessment of verbal working memory) and block spatial span (spatial working memory) tests. In addition, other aspects of prefrontal cognitive functioning will be assessed using the N‐back task, Tower of London planning task, FAS verbal fluency task and the trail making task (A &B).

In addition, baseline assessment of premorbid intellectual functioning will be conducted using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ‐ 3rd edition (WAIS‐III)([28]). Symptoms: Symptoms of schizophrenia will be assesed with the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) [29]. In addition, as prefrontal tDCS may well modify negative symptoms, these will be assessed in more detail with the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) [30]. We will allow for the capacity to control for effects on mood of prefrontal rTMS by assessing depression with the Calgary Depression Scale [31]. Electroencephalography: Where possible (based on laboratory availability) EEG will be recorded before and after tDCS to assess the effect of tDCS on alpha, beta, delta, theta and gamma power bands using a standard 64 channel Neuroscan EEG system used in many studies by our group. Analysis We will use a series of repeated measures ANOVA models to assess change in positive, negative and cogntive symptoms over time between the groups. There is no data on which to base a smaple size calculation: we have planned a larger sample than that used in most rTMS and tDCS trials and will conduct an interim analysis after the recruitment of 20 patients to re‐estimate the sample size.

AB  -  Deep brain stimulation has been successfully used in treatment of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. In a recent multi‐center prospectively randomized study, deep brain stimulation of the fornix was administered in order to ameliorate the cognitive symptoms and clinical course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study points to the possibility of modest slowing of the cognitive decline in AD in a subset of patients older than 65, while at the same time highlights the risk of stimulation in exacerbation of this decline in younger patients. The logic of conducting large clinical trials in the face of limited scientific understanding of the pathophysiology of AD and response of affected brain regions to electrical stimulation, is discussed with emphasis on the need to conduct: (i) animal studies in AD models, using precise focused stimulation; (ii) studies in patients who are implanted with depth electrodes for established clinical reasons (i.e., patients with epilepsy or movement disorders); and (iii) smaller adaptive studies in AD patients with systematic alterations of therapeutic parameters such as stimulation protocol.

AB  -  Introduction: Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a form of repetitive TMS that produces transient after‐effects on cortical excitability that are thought to reflect Hebbian LTP/LTD‐like synaptic plasticity effects1. Recent meta‐analyses of sixty‐four trials reports that iTBS robustly increases cortical excitability (mean potentiation 35.5%) and cTBS decreases cortical excitability (mean depression ‐22.8%) for up to 60 minutes2. Methods: 13 healthy older adults (6 male, age 70±3) enrolled. Protocol included two identical single‐pulse TMS protocols measuring cortical excitability both immediately before and after iTBS. This single‐pulse stimulation protocol comprised a stimulus‐response curve while participants maintained a background tonic voluntary contraction of APB (20% of maximum contraction). The pulses were delivered in pseudo‐randomized order, ranging in stimulus intensity from 80% to 160% of AMT. The standard iTBS protocol comprised of 600 pulses4. Results & Discussion: Three components of the Boltzmann‐fitted curve were examined to study effects of iTBS on cortical excitability: 1) MEP Amplitude, 2) Gain/Slope (i.e., inverse of spread), and 3) Midpoint (i.e., indicative of motor threshold). Paired T‐Tests yield divergent findings with significantly increased MEP amplitude at maximum stimulus intensity (t(12)=2.92, p=0.0128), yet significantly increased spread, which reflects a decrease in the gain of MEP as a function of stimulus intensity (t(12)=3.19, p=0.007). The findings may be explained by the differential effects of iTBS on I‐Waves and D‐Waves; I‐Waves, which primarily comprise MEPs at lower intensities, are influenced by iTBS while the D‐Waves that contribute at higher intensities are not5. Alternatively, the decreased slope may be reflection of metaplastic effects evoked by prior neural activation in our active condition6. A parallel trial with excitability measures obtained at rest is ongoing to investigate further.

AB  -  Schizophrenia is associated with impairments across several cognitive functions, including reaction time, prospective time estimation, working memory, verbal learning and memory, attention, and executive functions. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an effective non‐invasive technique that may hold clinical relevance for the treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as psychosis (delusions and hallucinations), depressive mood, anxiety, irritability/lability, apathy, euphoria, disinhibition, and agitation/aggression. However, DLPFC stimulation may not be very effective for cognitive and executive functions. Recent evidence has been suggested the role of cerebellum in cognitive and executive tasks but the effects of cerebellar tACS in patients with schizophrenia are ambiguous. The aim of the current study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of delta and theta frequency tACS of the cerebellar vermis on cognition in patients with schizophrenia. We used interval‐time‐estimation task (3 s and 12 s) that could represent both cognitive and executive functions. EEG signals were collected from the centro‐medial (“Fz/Cz”) and other locations during interval‐ timing tasks before and after the tACS. We applied anodal stimulation on cerebellar region and cathodal lead was located on the shoulder. We also examined the efficacy of stimulation based on cognitive scores pre/post cerebellar stimulation. Patients with schizophrenia showed reduction in accurately estimation of 3 and 12 second intervals as compared to healthy control subjects. Single session of either delta or theta frequency cerebellar tACS did not influence interval‐timing performance in patients. Time‐frequency spectrograms showed no significant changes in oscillatory activity around 3 s and 12 s cue events after delta frequency cerebellar tACS at the centro‐ medial cortical region. However, theta tACS increased oscillatory activity around cues. Change in activity was more prominent in lower frequency band (4‐8 Hz) between 500‐1000 ms from the cue events. Increased oscillatory activity was observed around the response time. These results speculate that theta tACS improved task‐related lower frequency oscillations but did not affect behavioral response due to the delayed (at 500‐1000 ms) cue‐related evoked activity as compared to normal subjects (at 0‐500 ms). We suggest that cerebellar neuromodulation approach, with appropriate stimulation parameters, could be an alternative therapeutic strategy to improve cognitive and executive functions in patients with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric diseases. 2 Introduction: There is a significant correlation between cognitive impairment and electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities in the frontal cortical regions in patients with schizophrenia [1, 2]. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited attenuated frontal, low‐frequency (1‐8 Hz) rhythms during interval‐timing performance as compared to healthy control subjects [1]. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to the cortical regions is an effective, non‐invasive technique that may hold clinical relevance to improve cognition [3]. TACS is a relatively safe and inexpensive way to pass electrical current non‐invasively through the skull in a frequency specific manner that can modulate neuronal activity of the target and connected brain network. Recent evidence has been suggested the role of cerebellum in cognitive and executive tasks [4], but the effects of cerebellar tACS in patients with schizophrenia are ambiguous. The cerebellum is densely connected to the frontal cortex and may influence brain rhythms necessary for normal cognitive function. Evidence suggests that cerebellar stimulation may be able to rescue frontal brain rhythms essential for normal cognition despite physiologic abnormalities that impair function and performance in schizophrenia [1]. The aim of the current study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of theta frequency tACS of the cerebellar vermis on frontal brain oscillations in patients with schizophrenia as a mechanism for enhanced cognitive function. We also tested the effect of delta frequency cerebellar tACS as a control for the effect of stimulation of sensory receptors or physical stimulation. 3 Methods: A total of 9 patients “on” medication with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (7 men, 2 women) were included in this study with written informed consent provided. Single sessions of delta (control) and theta frequency tACS (mindalive inc) were delivered with anodal pulsed current stimulation of the cerebellar midline targeting the vermis (cathodal electrode on the right shoulder). Stimulation was delivered for 20 minutes, with 1 mA peak‐to‐peak amplitude at either delta (n=8) or theta (n=9) frequencies. Delta and theta stimulation session order was randomized and separated by 1‐3 months. EEG recording was collected before (“pre”) and after (“post”) cerebellar tACS. EEG signals were recorded with a sampling rate of 500 Hz from 21 channels based on the 10‐20 system. Continuous data were re‐referenced to the mathematical average. Signals were segmented on the basis of the stimulus (cue) onset (‐2 to 6 s for 3 s trials; ‐2 to 18 s for 12 s trials). Time‐frequency analysis was computed by wavelet convolution with a baseline period 300 to 200 ms prior to cue onset. The interval‐timing task involved the appearance of a “3 sec” or “12 sec” text cue on the computer screen indicating both the interval of time to estimate and the start of the trial (Fig.1A). A motor indication of the elapse of the cued time interval was made by pressing the keyboard space bar. The interval‐timing task contained 80 total trials with 3 s and 12 s intervals presented in random order. All analyses in this report are from the centro‐medial electrode “Fz”. 4 Results: Patients with schizophrenia are impaired on the interval‐ timing task and have significantly decreased low‐frequency activity following the cue onset [1]. Twenty minutes of theta frequency tACS (or the control, delta condition) did not alter median response time (p>0.05) for 3 s and 12 s interval‐timing performance (Fig. 1B and C). Additionally, theta frequency tACS (or delta control stimulation) did not modify cue related activity in any frequency range at electrode “Fz” for 3 s or 12 s trials. Even, theta frequency tACS did not modulate 1‐4 Hz oscillatory activity around the time of the cue for both 3 s and 12 s trials (Fig. 1D and F). However, theta frequency tACS increased 4‐8 Hz (theta band) oscillatory activity around the time of cue for both 3 s and 12 s trials (Fig. 1E and G, permutation‐corrected statistical significance p<0.05 outlined in bold lines). Interestingly, in the current study, the increased theta band activity was not exclusively consistent with that of previous report from healthy controls as it was delayed in onset by 0.5 seconds. Patients with cognitive deficits significantly misjudge the elapse of time and exhibit higher error rate while performing higher‐order cognitive tasks. They also show significantly decreased midfrontal oscillatory activity in the lower frequency band (4‐8 Hz) at 0‐0.5 s from cue [1, 5]. 5 Discussion and Conclusion: Alternating current stimulation may be an effective method to entrain the dominant brain oscillations which can be task‐ and region‐specific [3]. Therefore, theta frequency stimulation may drive dominant or synchronized theta band oscillations in the target (frontal cortical) and associated regions during the performance of interval‐timing task [1, 6]. Although, the tACS frequency‐dependent changes in time‐frequency spectrograms were seen in this study, there were no significant changes in performance on the interval‐timing task. It may be possible that a single session of tACS was not robust enough to induce significant changes in brain oscillatory activity needed to modify performance on a core cognitive‐timing task. Therefore, repeated or longer duration tACS sessions may induce long‐lasting or more robust changes in midfrontal oscillatory activity at lower frequency bands that may have eventually led to significant behavioral improvement. Although the results presented here do not support our hypothesis, changes in theta activity in the frontal cortex following cerebellar tACS ignites the need for additional work exploring cerebellar modulation of frontal cortices in disease more specifically, additional work using an approach such as transcranial magnetic stimulation which has been reported to induce long‐lasting structural changes in the fiber tracts connecting the cerebellum and frontal cortex. In patients with schizophrenia, cerebello‐frontal activity may be compromised and a low‐frequency neuromodulation approach targeting cerebellum can “rescue" activity at low‐frequency bands in the frontal cortical regions, normalizing the cerebello‐frontal network that improves behavioral response. This is a line of research that warrants further pursuit and exploration. TACS itself is a highly understudied neuromodulation method, and the implications of its use in the cerebellum of healthy or diseased populations is even less studied. Schizophrenia remains a major source of mental illness worldwide, and research looking for new therapies to address the disabling cognitive deficits of the disease should be a priority.

AB  -  As perWorld Health Organization 47.5 million people worldwide have dementia and there are 7.7 million new cases every year. It is estimated that these numbers will double by the year 2030. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders are the most common cause of dementia and constitute 60%‐70% of these cases. The challenges posed by these growing numbers are multifold. First, by the time dementia is diagnosed the brain has sustained substantial insult thereby limiting the efficacy of current interventions. Thus there is a need to identify and target high risk groups for early diagnosis and to develop preventive strategies. Secondly, there is a need to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for cognitive dysfunction to develop targeted interventions. Thirdly, neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia cause significant distress to patients and caregivers and pose a major management challenge. In this symposium we will discuss 1. The role of later life neuropsychiatric symptoms as an at risk state for cognitive decline and dementia. Then we will review cognitive screening instruments and their interpretation in assisting an early diagnosis of dementia. 2. Design of a large randomized controlled trial to study the efficacy of a preventive intervention using transcranial direct current stimulation and cognitive remediation for AD in high risk groups. 3. Findings from a study aimed at identification of underlying neurophysiological mechanisms and novel treatment targets in patients with AD using Transcranial magnetic stimulation and quantitative electroencephalography. 4. An evidence‐based approach for assessment and management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia to optimize treatment outcomes.

AB  -  This is an interventional, sham controlled, double‐blind study in patients with early to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The study will enroll approximately 55 individuals with amyloid positive Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or AD. Each subject will undergo a 1‐2 visit screening period consisting of a physical and neurological exam, medical history and medication review, safety questionnaires, and cognitive testing. Each subject will then undergo 5‐7 baseline visits including neuropsychological testing (memory and thinking tests), amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging if one is not available or it has been greater than 6 months, tau PET imaging, tACS‐EEG (transcranial alternating current stimulation and electroencephalogram) assessment, TMS‐EEG (transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalogram) plasticity assessment, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), blood and saliva sample collection, and optional lumbar puncture (LP). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: stimulation for 2 weeks or 4 weeks, once a day or twice a day. One of the groups is a sham group. This means that this group will not receive actual tACS. Each session will be one hour of either individualized gamma‐frequency (40 Hz) tACS or sham tACS, depending on the assigned group. Subjects will be assessed for any side effects before and after each session and complete a short memory and thinking test either daily or weekly. At the end of the daily sessions, 5‐7 follow up visits will include a repeat of the baseline measures including amyloid and tau PET scans. Long‐term follow‐up visits will include an EEG, cognitive testing and an amyloid PET scan. The PET imaging studies will be conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital and up to 5 PET scans will be performed.

KW  -  Stroke
AB  -  OBJECTIVES There is no universally accepted strategy to promote recovery of motor function after stroke, the main cause of long‐term disability among adults. Neurorehabilitation contributes to recovery during the first days to weeks after stroke and later decelerates. Therefore, it is desirable to develop strategies to enhance rehabilitative effects on motor recovery particularly in the early phase after stroke in this patient group. We have recently demonstrated that cortical stimulation in the form of TMS enhances the beneficial effects of motor training and cortical plasticity in healthy volunteers and that tDCS (another noninvasive more comfortable stimulating technique than TMS transiently improves functional motor skills of the paretic hand of chronic stroke patients in the absence of training. Given the paucity of strategies available to enhance neurorehabilitation after stroke, it is now crucial to determine if tDCS can enhance the beneficial effects of customarily used rehabilitative treatment. tDCS has been used in several hundred subjects worldwide and in approximately 9 stroke patients, 15 Parkinson's disease patients and 15 healthy volunteers in our lab in the absence of undesirable side effects. In addition to the above objectives, we will also apply functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) techniques to determine the extent of changes in neural responses and functional shift in cortical representations/reorganization as a result of the proposed intervention strategies. fMRI as a measure is important in understanding changes in brain activation prior to, during, and after motor recovery and the effects of tDCS and the rehabilitative treatment strategies under investigation. Integrating TMS together with fMRI studies will provide crucial information on the functional role of brain regions activated in neuroimaging studies in association with functional recovery. STUDY POPULATION We plan to study 120 patients with a single cortical or subcortical subacute stroke. Thirty healthy volunteers and a sub‐group of 30 patients from the 120 patient population will also be recruited in the fMRI and TMS part of the study. The reason for including 30 patients in the fMRI and TMS components of the study is that it is anticipated that not all the 120 patients recruited in the initial study (i.e., the tDCS and therapeutic intervention phase) may be able to perform the tasks required for the fMRI part of the study and also satisfy the Exclusion criteria for fMRI scans. In addition, based on previous studies and preliminary fMRI power analysis, we estimate that 30 patients is likely to be sufficient to provide a representative sample of the patient group for the testing of the hypotheses stated in the protocol. Thirty healthy volunteers are necessary for the fMRI and TMS components of the study in order to obtain normative data for the TMS and fMRI components of the investigation. They will have the multiple number of TMS and fMRI sessions as patients in order to obtain descriptive information on the variability of these measures in both groups. DESIGN Normal volunteers will be recruited only for the fMRI and TMS part of the study which will be carried out at the NIH. They will be screened based on the criteria listed in the protocol and receive a neurological exam to determine their qualification for the proposed studies. OUTCOME MEASURES The purpose of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that tDCS applied in combination with customary rehabilitative training as used in the community (RT) will enhance motor recovery 3 months after admission relative to placebo and RT, and that functional recovery is associated with changes in cortical excitability in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsal pre‐motor cortex. The tDCS part of the study will be done at the NRH (where is being evaluated in parallel with the NINDS review process). Patients will be included in the protocol as soon as they are admitted to the NRH for RT (usually 3‐10 days after the ictal event). Patients, who are eligible for the protocol will be randomized in one of the two study arms: RT + tDCS or RT + placebo stimulation. In both study arms patients will take part in daily customary RT procedures. We will record the specific rehabilitative therapy received by the patient. In the tDCS study arm, patients will receive tDCS of the motor cortex associated with RT every other day for the time of the inpatient stay (14 days). Placebo will be implemented in the same way and with the same stimulating equipment in place as tDCS. Patient and therapist (who will provide treatment and determine the primary outcome measure) will not be aware of arm participation (double‐blind study design). Primary outcome measure will be the Jebsen‐Tailor‐Test (JTT), a test measuring the functional abilities of the hand in daily living activities. Secondary outcome measures will include the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the Fugl‐Meyer‐scale (FMS), the MRC scale, the Abilhand scale (AHS), Barthel Index, Ashworth‐Spasticity scale (ASS), and grating orientation task (GOT) and the NIH stroke scale. For the fMRI and TMS studies, changes in BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) response and delayed reaction time will be the outcome measures.

KW  -  Phobic Disorders
AB  -  OVERVIEW The experiment will consist of four days. Day 1 will include informed consent, questionnaires, a behavioral approach test with a spider, a series of short exposures with a spider, and the first TMS treatment (for a total of approximately 75‐90 minutes). Day 2 will occur one to two days after Day 1 and will consist of a second series of short exposures with a spider and the second TMS treatment (30 minutes). Day 3 will occur one to two days after Day 2 and will also consist of a series of short exposures and a TMS treatment (30 minutes). Day 4 will occur five to seven days after Day 3 and will consist of post‐study questionnaires and an identical behavioral approach test as is conducted on the first visit (30 minutes). Participants will be randomized to either an active TMS treatment group (using an iTBS stimulation protocol over the participant's ventro‐medial prefrontal cortex, an area involved in phobic response) or a control TMS treatment group (using the same iTBS stimulation protocol over the central sulcus and between hemispheres, a site not associated with memory or fear response). Prospective participants will be recruited from two groups: 1) undergraduate students recruited through the UCLA Psychology Department Subject Pool (i.e., SONA) and 2) general population over the age of 18 recruited via flyers. All prospective participants will be screened with the 31‐question Spider Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ) to ensure eligibility for participation, with a minimum total score equal to or greater than 17 required for participation.(Klorman, Weerts, Hastings, Melamed, & Lang, 1974) Participants will be enrolled for the study only if they are able to complete all four visits of the experiment. Exclusion criteria will include: 1. Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated, unable to give informed consent. 2. Subjects with psychosis (psychotic depression, schizophrenia, or schizoaffective diagnoses (lifetime)); bipolar disorder (lifetime); dementia (lifetime); delirium within the past 6 months; eating disorder within the past year; obsessive‐compulsive disorder (lifetime); post‐traumatic stress disorder within the past year; acute risk for suicide or self‐injurious behavior. Patients with diagnostic uncertainty or ambiguity (e.g. rule‐out pseudodementia of depression) will be excluded. 3. Subjects with a HamD suicidality item score of '3' or '4,' corresponding to "suicidal ideas or gestures" or "attempts at suicide," will be excluded. 4. Subjects with exposure to ECT within the past 6 months, previous TMS treatment for any condition, or VNS treatment (lifetime). 5. Past history of skull fracture; cranial surgery entering the calvarium; space occupying intracranial lesion; stroke, CVA, or TIAs; cerebral aneurysm; Parkinson's or Huntington's disease; or Multiple Sclerosis. 6. Any history of intracranial implant including cochlear implant, implanted electrodes/stimulators, aneurysm clips or coils, stents, bullet fragments; implanted cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, vagus nerve stimulator, deep brain stimulator; or other implanted devices or objects contraindicated by product labeling. 8. current pregnancy or breast feeding. 9. Infection or loss of integrity of skin over the forehead, where the device will be positioned. 11. Known bee, insect, or arachnid allergy 12. Other medical contraindications to any of the study procedures. 1. Stand 5 feet away from tarantula in closed terrarium 2. Stand 1 foot away from tarantula in terrarium with top removed 3. Place both hands on the side of terrarium with top removed 4. Touch nose against the glass of terrarium while looking at the tarantula 5. Place gloved hand halfway inside terrarium 7. Neurological conditions including epilepsy, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, increased intracranial pressure, history of repetitive or severe head trauma, or with primary or secondary tumors in the CNS. 10. Increased risk of seizure as indicated by: a) history (or family history) of seizure or epilepsy; b) history of stroke, head injury, or unexplained seizures; c) concurrent medication use such as tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptic medications, or other drugs that are known to lower the seizure threshold; d) secondary conditions that may significantly alter electrolyte balance or lower seizure threshold; e) no quantifiable motor threshold such that TMS dosage cannot be accurately determined. Participants will be assigned course credit or receive financial compensation after participating in the study. Those who participate through SONA recruitment will receive course credit. Participants will sign up for the study only if they are able to make all four visits of the experiment. If a participant does not attend all three visits, course credit will still be given for the amount of time the participant spent doing the experiment (i.e., 1 credit for 1 hour). After screening, participants will be emailed blank copies of the forms, questionnaires, and screening tools that will be completed during the first visit, and they will be informed that they may complete the forms in advance and bring the completed forms with them to save time, should they desire. They will be asked to not return their forms via email, and to only bring them to the first visit. DAY 1 On Day 1, participants will first provide informed consent after the nature of the study has been fully explained and the participant has had time to ask questions. After obtaining informed consent, participants will complete a demographics and eligibility questionnaire (see Section 10.1, Item 1.0) or hand in their already‐completed forms, which will be reviewed by the researcher upon completion. Ineligible participants (i.e., participants with bee, insect, or spider allergies, with scores below 17 on the SPQ, who do not speak English, are taking medications that lower the seizure threshold, or other exclusion criteria as listed in section 11.1) will be informed that they do not meet criteria and the research session will be terminated at this time. Participants found to be ineligible will still receive 1 credit for their time. All to‐be‐administered questionnaires are listed below and uploaded in Section 10.1, Item 1.0 of this IRB submission. Spider Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ; Klorman et al, 1974) Demographics & Eligibility Questionnaire Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ; Szymanski & O'Donohue, 1995) PHQ2 PHQ9 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (specifically the suicidality item) GAD7 Tracking and Reimbursement (this questionnaire is used exclusively to track the number of visits completed and information necessary to ensuring that participants receive the proper financial or course credit compensation for their time; it contains no research data used for the study) 6. Place gloved hand inside terrarium with all fingertips touching base of terrarium 7. Place bare hand inside terrarium with all fingertips touching base of terrarium 8. Touch the back of the tarantula's leg continuously with a Q‐tip 9. Touch the back of the tarantula's leg continuously with the tip of the index finger All participants will complete a BAT with a live tarantula. This phase of the experiment consists of 9 steps, lasting 30 seconds each with a 30 second pause between each step. During the BAT, self‐reported and physiological data will be collected at each step. Skin conductance response (SCR) and heart‐rate variability (HRV) will be utilized as physiologic measures of fearful arousal using BIOPAC MP150 hardware and AcqKnowledge version 4.2 software (BIOPAC Systems, Inc.).(Appelhans & Luecken, 2006; Choi et al., 2017; Christopoulos, Uy, & Yap, 2016; Laine, Spitler, Mosher, & Gothard, 2009; Thayer, Åhs, Fredrikson, Sollers, & Wager, 2012; Williams et al., 2001) Baseline SCR and HRV will be measured during a 3‐minute prior to initiation of a BAT. SCR will be recorded from electrodes attached to the subjects' second and third fingers. Average SCRs and peak SCRs at each step will be measured and compared to individual baselines. HRV will be calculated from R‐R intervals in a lead II electrode configuration recording; average HRVs from each step will be compared to individual baselines. The steps are as follows: Prior to beginning the BAT, all participants will be read instructions reporting the following: The experiment consists of 9 steps, each lasting 30 seconds. Instructions for each step will be read aloud before the participant proceed to the next step. Each step must be completed before moving on to the next step, and steps much be completed in sequential order. During each step, participant's heart rate and sweating will be recorded via the electrodes on participant's chest and finger. After the experimenter reads the instructions for the next step and prior to completing the step, the participant will also be asked to rate participant's confidence level to complete the step on a scale from 0 to 100 (0= no confidence, 25= mild confidence, 50= moderate confidence, 75= high confidence, 100 = complete confidence) and participant's anticipatory distress on a scale from 0 to 100 (0=no distress, 25=mild distress, 50=moderate distress, 75= high distress, 100= severe distress). After completion of each step, participants will be asked to rate their maximum level of distress during the step on a scale from 0 to 100. Participants are entitled to withdraw at any step if they do not wish to continue. At this point participants will have an opportunity to ask questions before beginning testing. The first step of the experiment is to stand 5 feet away from the tarantula while it is in its closed container for 30 seconds. The final step of the experiment is to touch the back of the tarantula's leg with the tip of participant's index finger continuously for 30 seconds. ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT Study personnel administering the BAT and exposure treatments will be bachelors‐level trained or current UCLA students. These personnel have not been identified at this time, but will be added to the IRB and protocols as they are identified. They will be trained by personnel from Anxiety and Depression Research Center (ADRC; personnel under the supervision of Dr. Michelle Craske) in both how to properly administer the BAT and exposure treatments, as well as how to address any questions, concerns, or unexpected events that arise from these treatments (including acute episodes of psychological distress, escape of spiders, etc.). These personnel have ample experience in training others how to administer these treatments. Before beginning the BAT and after ensuring comprehension of the above instructions, the experimenter will ask the participant to rate his/her overall confidence and overall anticipatory distress with respect to his/her ability to complete all nine steps (see rating scales in above instructions). Before each subsequent step, the participant will be asked to rate his/her confidence and anticipatory distress regarding his/her ability to complete that particular step. During each step, the experimenter will record the spider's movement on a categorical scale (0 = no movement, 1 = a little movement, 2 = a lot of movement). After each step, the participant will be asked to rate his/her maximum level of distress while completing that particular step. Finally, the experimenter will record the number of steps willingly completed for a given participant. Next, all participants will engage in a series of exposure practices with a different live tarantula from the one they saw during the BAT. Exposure therapy will consist of a series of 10 identical exposure trials of a 30‐second duration with a 30‐second pause between trials. Participants will be asked to place an ungloved hand in the terrarium (with all fingertips touching the base of the terrarium) on the opposite end of the terrarium as the tarantula during the trial. Prior to completing the series of exposures, participants will be asked about their feared outcome concerning approaching the tarantula (e.g., being bitten). Participants are entitled to withdraw at any step during exposures and will not be prevented from further continuation in the study. DAY 2 As described above, this visit will occur one to two days after Day 1. All participants will return to the laboratory to engage in a second series of exposure practices with the same tarantula from exposures at the first visit. They will undergo 10 identical exposure trials for durations of 30 seconds each, with a 30‐second pause between trials. During each exposure trial, they will again be asked to place an ungloved hand in the terrarium (with all fingertips touching the base of the terrarium) on the opposite end of the terrarium as the tarantula during the trial. Prior to completing the series of exposures, participants will be asked about their feared outcome concerning approaching the tarantula (e.g., being bitten). Participants are entitled to withdraw at any step during exposures and will not be prevented from further continuation in the study. Following the series of exposure practices, participants will undergo a TMS treatment using an iTBS treatment protocol in the same location that they received stimulation on Day 1 (vmPFC vs. vertex). DAY 3 This visit will be identical to Day 2, and will occur one to two days after Day 2. After completion of Day 4, participants will be compensated for their time with one credit per hour of study participation. Hypotheses will be tested using between‐group two‐tailed t‐tests given that investigators are testing not only for magnitude of an effect, but also direction of an effect. Investigators expect that comparisons of efficacy will demonstrate increased confidence during BAT approach, decreased endorsed fear of spiders as measured by SPQ and FSQ, and reduced physiologic response to stimulus (reduced HRV and SCR) with active iTBS and exposure when compared to control iTBS and exposure. Investigators expect that comparisons of feasibility and tolerability will show no significant difference between attendance to, early termination of, or subjective tolerability ratings of TMS treatment sessions between treatment groups. Following the series of exposures, participants will undergo TMS treatments using an iTBS protocol. Before the first iTBS treatment, the TMS coil will be calibrated to the subject's individual resting motor threshold (RMT), or the minimum stimulus intensity necessary to elicit a motor response in the right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) or first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscles for ≥ 50% of stimuli applied to the motor cortex. After initial calibration, the TMS coil will be placed over the subject's ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC; as determined using position Fpz of the international 10‐20 EEG electrode system), a TMS target shown to affect phobic response.(Baeken et al., 2010; Guhn et al., 2012, 2014; Suarez‐Jimenez et al., 2018) Stimulation intensity of 100% of the individual RMT in bursts of three pulses at a frequency of 50 Hz every 200 ms on top of a 5Hz carrier wave. Pulse delivery is over 2 s and repeated every 10 s, 20 times in succession, for a total of 600 pulses delivered in 3.33 minutes.(Baeken et al., 2010; Bulteau et al., 2017; Guhn et al., 2014) This specific protocol was selected based on the assumption that it should impact fear circuitry top‐down from prefrontal to subcortical networks (particularly the amygdala) as seen in prior work.(Baeken et al., 2010; Bulteau et al., 2017; Guhn et al., 2014) Control iTBS will consist of the same stimulation parameters over the subject's midline central sulcus or vertex (as determined using position Cz, of the international 10‐20 EEG electrode system). This placement was chosen for control as its position over the vertex will minimize amount of cortex stimulated and the stimulated area is not associated with the circuitry examined in this experiment.(Duecker & Sack, 2015) It is a commonly‐used control site in TMS studies because it is associated with no known effects and has a similar risk profile to other TMS sites. (Foltys et al., 2001; Jung, Bungert, Bowtell, & Jackson, 2016; Rossi et al., 2009; Weiss, Sparing, Fink, Tomasino, & Dafotakis, 2008) It is generally associated with lower rates of scalp discomfort and no clinically‐observed behavioral or mood effects.(Jung et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2009) Some work has demonstrated a possible decrease in activation of the default mode network, though this has not been found to be clinically‐significant.(Jung et al., 2016) Three Chilean Rose Tarantulas (Grammostola rosea) will be stored in individual terrariums with weighted lids in a locked room within the ADRC (Life Sciences 5347), under the supervision of Dr. Michelle Craske and her laboratory personnel. All BATs and exposure treatments will take place in a controlled closed room without windows, open vents, or other large openings, to minimize the likelihood of a tarantula escape. At the beginning and end of every study session, study personnel will confirm the presence of the tarantula within the terrarium and confirm complete closure of the terrarium. After termination of testing for the day, study personnel will again confirm of the presence of the spider and the terrarium closure before departing. Any injury sustained in the process of a spider escape or containment, such as a spider bite, will be reported as an adverse event. Should such an event emerge, study personnel present at the time of the event will be asked to contact the PI or a study clinician, who will assess the severity of the event. If the PI is not contacted in real‐time, personnel will contact the PI within 24 hours of the event, and the PI will then report the adverse event within 24 hours of being informed. DAY 4 This visit will occur five to seven days after Day 3. All participants will complete the Spider Phobia Questionnaire (SPQ; Klorman et al, 1974) and Fear of Spiders Questionnaire (FSQ; Szymanski & O'Donohue, 1995), uploaded in Section 10.1, Item 1.0, to test for change in arachnophobia fear/avoidance symptoms as a function of TMS treatment received. Next, all participants will complete an identical BAT to that completed at their first visit with the same tarantula (see DAY 1 above). Self‐report and physiological (i.e., SCR) data will again be collected. After completion of these forms, participants will be debriefed by an un‐blinded member of the study team and informed to which group they are assigned. They will be encouraged to discuss whatever questions or concerns they have regarding the study at that time. Dependent variables (DVs) will be quantitative self‐reports and behavioral symptoms of fear and avoidance of spiders both pre‐ and post‐treatment, including SCR (difference between baseline and average level during BAT anticipation period, and number of peaks during BAT), total number of steps completed during the BAT, self‐reported distress, anticipatory distress, and maximum distress per BAT step, and total score on the SPQ. BAT measures will be collected for each step and therefore minima, maxima, and means will be compared between the two groups. Primary outcomes examined will be number of steps completed during BAT, self‐reported distress during BAT, number of SCR peaks during BAT, SPQ score, and FOS score. All other variables examined will be secondary outcomes. Additionally, for feasibility and tolerability assessment, attendance to TMS treatment sessions and early termination of TMS treatment sessions will be recorded. The primary independent variable examined will be the treatment group (iTBS vs. control iTBS). The sample size will be 40 participants (20 per group). Pre‐comparison ANOVA will be performed to limit type 1 error due to multiplicity of comparisons. In the event that a spider should escape from its terrarium, the participant will be removed from the room and study personnel will immediately re‐close the room, search for the tarantula, and transfer it back to the terrarium in a manner safe for both the personnel and the spider when found. This will involve coaxing the spider to a sealable pre‐dampened carrier, temporarily sealing it, and opening it inside the spider's terrarium. Though the risk posed by a tarantula bite or hair projection is low and the risk of occurrence is low, study personnel will don gloves, eye protection, and a long‐sleeved labcoat (all three of which will be provided) before attempting transfer to minimize this risk. If not found after a thorough search, the room will remain closed, and other laboratory personnel and the PI will be notified, and further action will be taken to locate the spider. Investigators will employ the following strategy to manage suicidality and other serious adverse events (SAEs). All exposure and TMS procedures will be performed during normal working hours while there is a psychiatrist on duty at the Clinical TMS Service. Should participants become acutely distressed during a study visit, the attending psychiatrist on duty will take any steps necessary to address any clinical issues that emerge. The PI will follow up with all participants by phone 12‐24 hours after all exposure treatments to ensure that they are not suffering from ongoing distress, and participants will be given contact information for the PI to reach out sooner should they desire. The PI will involve licensed clinicians as appropriate. At the initial study visit, subjects will complete the PHQ2 (reflex to PHQ9), GAD7, and HamD suicidality item and review their responses with a research assistant and clinician. All subjects also will be reminded at each visit about the availability of a clinician should the subject develop any event of concern, including suicidality or adverse events. Should such an event emerge, the subject will be instructed to contact the PI or a study clinician, who will assess the presentation as per their standard clinical protocol. This assessment will categorize the SAE as emergent or nonemergent. For non‐emergent events, the clinicians will manage as they see fit. Rapid consultation with the Principal Investigator is available; should the clinician contact the PI, he or she will then be responsible for reporting the event as an SAE. If a consultation with the PI is not pursued in real‐time, the clinician will inform the PI of the event within 24 hours of having identified the event. For emergent events, such as the worsening of suicidality or self‐injurious behavior, the clinician will instruct the subject to go to the nearest emergency room possible. Should the clinician be concerned about the subject's imminent safety, he or she may contact the individual named by the subject in the consent form as the emergency contact, so that the contact person may help the subject get to an emergency room. If such an action is not feasible, the clinician may petition the subject to be brought involuntarily to the nearest emergency room possible, as provided for under state mental health laws in California where the study is being conducted. Consultation at any time is available by contacting the PI or a study clinician. Should the PI be contacted in real‐time, he will then be responsible for initiating the SAE reporting. If the PI is not contacted in real‐time, the clinician will contact the PI within 24 hours of the event, and the PI will then complete SAE reporting within 24 hours of being informed. All reports of adverse events will be reviewed by the PI and reported to the UCLA Institutional Review Board in accordance with its policies.

AB  -  Veterans aged 50 and above who have suffered mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are twice as prone to develop dementia. From 2001, during the Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) campaigns, over 470,000 veterans were diagnosed with TBI. Beyond the prevalence of the signature wound of the OEF and OIF campaigns, the number of mTBI cases within the VA system is believed to be much higher. Disturbingly, an increasing number of veterans, especially those with TBI, are being diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and frank dementia between ages 50‐60. With 72% of veterans (13.2 million, a figure rising yearly) over 50 years old (Vetpop, 2020), the VA needs to implement preventative and rehabilitative interventions to limit the growing impact of cognitive decline in the veteran population. Cognitive training paradigms have been developed and tested over the past decades, with some controversy over the overall effect10. Programs such as repeated task practice (e.g., list memorization and mnemonics) have shown mixed results in aggregate, primarily due to a lack of training transfer across domains. In contrast, process‐based cognitive training has consistently improved general cognitive ability with one program, visual attention training, showing considerable transfer effects. Also known as speed‐of‐processing training (cf. ‐ useful field‐of‐view [UFOV]), visual attention training is done on a computer and targets perceptual deficits associated with aging and TBI. Changes in brain function that reduce the ability for perceptual information to be processed are likely mechanisms of impaired cognition. Visual attention training was developed to increase visual perception directly to counteract deficient visual fields. Previous studies have shown that visual attention training increases instrumental daily activities pertinent to driving performance, resulting in prolonged driving mobility. Unfortunately, visual attention training paradigms have required an extended training duration (months) and tend to show varied outcomes. The identified cognitive mechanism of increased perceptual detail processing is quite powerful, but individual training response may depend on one's ability to apply selective cortical inhibition. Cortical oscillations measured with electroencephalography (EEG) are believed to reflect such inhibition. Recent EEG work during visual attention training has shown that people exhibiting selective engagement of alpha patterns have faster processing speed and better perceptual discrimination. Our recent VA‐funded projects in aging have shown that procedural motor learning performance is related to individual differences in excitatory/inhibitory (E/I balance) assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Novak et al., under review). Moreover, recent work has also shown that neurological changes in cortical activity are evident after just 10 hours of visual attention training. The current project will evaluate changes in EEG measures of cortical inhibition in older veterans to improve perceptual processing using an adapted visual attention training program. The present work expands on prior work in neuromodulation using low‐cost, nonpharmacological rehabilitation techniques.

KW  -  Huntington Disease
AB  -  Due to space constraints a more extensive description of the research study can be found in the study protocol. 1. Background and Rationale Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat trinucleotide expansion within the first exon of the huntingtin gene and causes a range of symptoms including motor, cognitive and psychiatric disturbances, which significantly affect daily activities, independence and quality of life, even during the early stages of the disease. Cognitive dysfunctions from early on in the HD disease process have been well documented and can include specific problems with attention, cognitive flexibility and memory. Indeed, difficulty sharing attention between more than one task has been demonstrated to be a specific and core deficit in HD. Cognitive training interventions, which focus on executive function, present a potentially exciting non‐pharmacological treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases including HD. Studies in HD mice have previously demonstrated executive function impairments, including deficits in attention and subsequent studies have shown that cognitive training can benefit HD mice and prevent the onset of cognitive and motor disease symptoms. This work suggests that an early cognitive training intervention can have significant and long‐lasting beneficial effects on HD symptoms. Although further systematic studies in mouse models of HD are required to inform the translational aspects of cognitive training interventions, these results provide important proof of principle evidence that cognitive training can provide benefit in mouse models of HD. Studies in human populations suggest that cognitive training, via repeatedly conducting tasks that require specific aspects of executive function such as attention, reasoning and memory, can improve cognitive function as people age. Computerised cognitive training studies have also been conducted in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These studies have found that computerised cognitive training that can improve cognition in PD and AD. However, a systematic literature review of Europe PubMed Central using the keywords, 'Huntington's disease' and 'cognitive training' or 'cognitive therapy' or 'brain training' or 'executive function training' conducted from the years 1950 to 2015, produced 2 results. A review on cognitive burden in HD and a paper on exercise in a mouse model of HD benefiting cognitive symptoms. Thus, the use of cognitive training in HD is a considerably under researched area and to our knowledge cognitive training is yet to be explored in HD. Therefore, feasibility studies, such as the one proposed in this application are crucial in trialing novel potential therapeutic interventions. The outcome measures used to determine patient benefit in cognitive training studies can vary significantly between studies. Furthermore, this is the first time that such an intervention has been used in people with HD. Therefore, the outcome measures used in cognitive training studies to determine patient benefit need to be carefully explored and defined prior to beginning the study. The candidate outcome measures for use in this study have been chosen to include both cognitive and motor measures specific to people with HD to best evaluate the outcome of the intervention. Difficulty sharing attention has been shown to be a specific problem in HD. Attentional sharing can be measured clinically using dual tasks where participants are required to do two tasks at the same time. The two tasks can be from the same modality such as walking and carrying a tray, or from different modalities such as walking combined with a cognitive component such as counting. Dual task studies have shown that people with HD have reduced attentional sharing capacity, particularly when the dual task has a cognitive element. As the ability to complete dual tasks and increasing attentional demand are key skills in everyday life, deficits in such tasks can severely affect independence, increase the risk of falls and reduce quality of life. The proposed study will use dual task performance to assess feasibility, acceptability and to gather preliminary efficacy data on the effect of cognitive training interventions in people with HD. Environmental enrichment has been shown to improve disease symptoms in HD mice and a retrospective study regarding lifestyle of people with HD suggests that a passive or sedentary lifestyle, lacking in enriching activities, may contribute to earlier onset of disease symptoms. There is also preliminary evidence that motor training can produce functional benefits in HD and accumulating evidence of feasibility and functional improvements from both in‐ and out‐patient exercise and rehabilitation programmes. Motor training exercise studies have shown that multi‐modal exercise interventions are well tolerated and associated with improvements in movement, cognition and mood alongside increases in health related quality of life. Work is now ongoing to develop methods to support and enhance adherence to home exercise in HD. Furthermore, the investigators now have preliminary evidence that an intervention with both motor and cognitive components (a training regimen in which patients' train to drum increasingly complex rhythms to music) can produce improvements on the symbol digit modalities, a test of executive function, with accompanying changes on MRI tractography. Brain imaging studies are hugely important in greater understanding the biological mechanisms which may underpin any intervention in a neurodegenerative disease. Strategies for conducting cognitive training can vary between research studies. Some use taught exercises or puzzles which participants learn and then repeat. However, the utilisation of computerised cognitive training strategies provides several advantages over repeating practical tasks. Computerised cognitive training strategies are automated and can be completed by participants at their convenience, they provide automated tasks which require comparatively little movement to complete and provide several objective outcome measures. Furthermore, the specific HAPPYneuron cognitive training software that the investigators are using in this study provides an interface for the researcher to observe the progress of study participants and it can be made available in different languages to allow for consistent training globally. However, as this is a feasibility study, the computerised cognitive training intervention will be optimised taking into account the feedback and views of people with HD. 2. Study Aims The primary aim of this study is to determine if computerised cognitive training, is feasible and acceptable for people with HD. The researchers will investigate the familiarity of participants with the computerised cognitive training programme, its usability and determine key outcome measures for use in cognitive training studies, before conducting a randomised feasibility study. The randomised feasibility study will also explore the biological underpinnings of any observed behavioral changes using MRI scanning, this is an optional component of the study. During this study, important parameters will be established, which will allow us to develop the intervention programme for use in a larger patient cohort. 2.1. Specific Objectives The objectives of the proposed study are to: (i) investigate the familiarity of participants ad usability of computerised cognitive training programmes and determine key outcome measures for use in cognitive training studies. (ii) assess the feasibility of delivering a home based computerised cognitive training programme for people with HD, considering: ‐ The willingness of eligible participants to receive the intervention and participate in a feasibility study (including the feasibility of randomisation) ‐ Potential barriers to recruitment or completion of the study ‐ Response rates and adherence to the cognitive training programme (iii) determine any behavioural changes which may occur during the intervention or comparable control arm. (iv) use brain imaging techniques to explore the biological underpinnings of any observed behavioral change (optional). (v) evaluate the intervention using participant and family member/carer feedback to future use in this patient population. 3. Study Design Participants will be recruited from the Cardiff Huntington's disease Centre. Participants will be asked to complete a range of computer and paper based cognitive tasks, motor tasks and interviews in their first research visit, which may coincide with their ENROLL‐HD visit. Participants will then be invited back to complete baseline assessments for the feasibility study within the next 4 weeks. After randomisation, those allocated to the intervention group will receive the 12‐week home‐based cognitive training intervention, supported by home visits and email or telephone reminders, as preferred. Those allocated to the control group will be asked to continue as normal although they will also receive home visits. At 6 weeks an optional MRI scan will be conducted in addition to cognitive tasks. 12 weeks after completing baseline assessments, participants will be invited back to complete the final outcome assessments. 5. Recruitment 5.1. Number of Participants This is an initial proof of principle study; thus no formal sample size calculations have been completed. The investigators will aim to recruit 50 participants with a target of randomising 40 participants. The suggested numbers are based on previous literature regarding cognitive training in other diseases and considering that MRI is an optional component of the study. The study team have funds for the MRI scanning of 16 participants during the study, scanning will be conducted on a first come first served basis and once the funds for scanning are used no further participants will be able to be scanned. This study is an essential step towards a larger systematic study of cognitive training and will inform the design and delivery of such a trial, as well as providing data to inform a power calculation to estimate sample size in the future. 5.2. Recruitment Process Potential participants, who have already consented to participate in ENROLL‐HD may be approached during their clinical visits and will be informed of the study. Potential participants will receive an information sheet about this study and be will be given sufficient time to ask questions and discuss the study with the researcher. If required, potential participants can take the information sheets home and discuss the study with their family and friends. Potential participants who wish to consent will be reminded that they can change their mind or withdraw without reason at any time. If the potential participant is willing to proceed with the study, they will be asked to sign a consent form and the study assessments will begin. 5.3. Informed Consent The participant will be allowed as much time as needed to consider the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and the opportunity to question the research team or independent parties to decide whether he/she will participate in the study. All participants will have the procedures explained in detail, including that the study design is randomised, that MRI scanning is an optional component and that they can withdraw at any time. Informed consent will then be obtained by means of participant dated signature and dated signature of the person who presented and obtained the informed consent. The original signed form will be retained at the study site. After informed consent has been received the first study visit will take place. Participants will be reminded that they can withdraw from the study at any time, without the need to give a reason and this will not affect their current or future care. Participants will be asked during the consent process if their family member or carer can be asked their opinions of cognitive training interventions, this is an optional component of the consent form. If consent is provided to ask family members, friends or carers that attend the clinic with the participant, they will be asked to read a separate information sheet. If they agree to participate, they will be asked to sign a consent form and they will then be interviewed regarding the study. 5.4. Health Checks/Screening Required for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scanning MRI scanning is an optional component of the study. Thus, as part of the pre‐screening process, all participants will be screened for contraindications to MRI. In addition, comprehensive screening for MRI contraindications will be completed immediately before each MRI scan by the researcher and the MRI operator before the participant is allowed into the scanning room. 5.5. Randomisation Procedures As the study includes an intervention and control group, randomisation will be performed using a minimisation procedure and programme to ensure balance between the groups for categorical variables of age and cognitive function. Minimisation will be performed by the researcher, considering age and cognitive results of the most recently published global ENROLL‐HD study data. Age and cognitive function will be given the same weighting during the minimisation procedure. Age will be classified into two categories: 1) < 45 years and 2) > 45 years. The total cognitive score of the participant in the Categorical Verbal Fluency Test, will be used to classify participants into two categories. The randomisation procedure will be carefully explained to all potential research participants and is specifically outlined in both the PIS and CF. Randomisation will only be performed after the participant has signed the CF and completed the initial and baseline assessments. Participants allocated to the control group will be asked to carry on as normal. Once allocated to a group, participants will receive an allocation letter detailing the group that they have been randomised to. Unfortunately, due to licencing restrictions those allocated to the control group will only be able to use the cognitive training software in the first research visit and during the baseline and outcome assessments of the second and third research visits. It will be made clear to all potential participants at the end of the study, they will have to stop using the cognitive training software as their access to the login system will expire. 6. Study Procedures 6.1 The 12‐week Cognitive Training Intervention The 12‐week cognitive training intervention will be completed in participant homes. The intervention will be supported by email, text and telephone reminders (as preferred by the participant and detailed in the Case Report Form) and home visits. Home visits will be conducted for both the active and control groups. Although additional home visits may be necessary if a participant is concerned about using the software. During the research visits, for the active group, the researcher will ensure that the participant is comfortable with the software, offering support and guidance and a battery of cognitive assessments will be performed. For the control group during home visits the researcher will complete the cognitive test battery and talk to the participant about their day. The intervention is designed to be conducted with minimal supervision and this is something that will be explored during participant and friend, family member or carer interviews. When completing home visits, the researcher will comply with the Lone Workers Policy in existence at the Cardiff HD Centre and will discuss visits with the research team prior to completing them to ensure that safety is not compromised at any time. Participants will be asked to complete the training programme provided using HAPPYneuron software for a minimum of 30 minutes 3 times a week for 12 weeks. After the participant completes the 30 minute training programme they will be free to complete any other of the 'games' available on the HAPPYneuron computerised cognitive training software. Completion of the cognitive training programme will be monitored and supported using email or telephone reminders (as preferred by the participant) and home visits by the researcher. This will allow patient adherence with the cognitive intervention programme to be monitored and therefore the feasibility and acceptability of the programme by the participant to be explored. Each participant will be provided with a unique log in. The software provides an interface that allows the researcher to track the regularity of use and progress of all study participants. Therefore, the investigators will be able to remotely determine how often and for how long participants are using the software and can analyse participant performance on each cognitive task. Furthermore, the performance of participants for each specific task, during each cognitive training session is measured and can be used to determine improvements in specific cognitive tasks, for example in response accuracy or response time, throughout the study. Participants will be made aware that the researcher is able to see their training activity throughout the study. The cognitive training software the investigators plan to use in this study is easy to use, is automated, provides non‐biased data recording, provides an interface which allows the researcher to track compliance remotely. It has previously been validated in both healthy controls and patients with depression, and has shown patient benefit including improved cognition and functionality. At the end of the study the participant login details will expire and they will no longer be able to access the cognitive training software, this is made clear in the PIS. The intervention is designed to be completed independently, although in this feasibility study, with the agreement of the participant, the investigators will be specifically exploring the involvement of any friends, family members of carers using semi‐structured interviews at the beginning and end of the study. 6.2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scanning Cardiff University has a world leading brain imaging research centre (CUBRIC) which provides access to state of the art research facilities and equipment. Therefore, MRI scanning will be used in this study, as an optional component, to greater explore the biological effects if any, that the cognitive training programme may have. Prior to consent, potential participants will be screened for any contradictions to MRI. Further screening will be conducted prior to any MRI scanning procedures. MRI scanning is an optional component of the feasibility study, therefore if participants cannot or do not want to undergo the MRI scanning procedures, they will still be able to take part in the study. Participants will also be made aware that they are free to withdraw from the MRI scanning component of the study at any time, without the need to give a reason and this will not affect the care that they receive. If a participant consents to MRI, the MRI scanning procedure will be carefully explained and discussed with the participant and the participant will have the opportunity to experience the 'mock' MRI scanner, if they feel this may be helpful. The MRI scan will be conducted at a research visit 6 weeks into the intervention. An MRI scan will then be conducted by a fully trained MR Operator with the help of a researcher who is MR safety trained. The scan will be acquired on a 3T Siemens Prisma scanner with 32 head coils. The MRI scanning protocol will include scans to assess a structural scan to assess gross macrostructure, microstructural scans to assess white matter and myelination changes as well as quantitative fMRI to measure resting cerebral blood flow. The complete scanning protocol is expected to last no longer than 90 minutes, but will be led by the participant to ensure that they are comfortable throughout the scanning procedure. 11. Study Closure Definition The end of study is the date of the last visit of the last research participant. 12. Indemnity Cardiff University will provide indemnity and compensation in the event of a claim by, or on behalf of participants, for negligent harm as a result of the study design and/or in respect of the protocol authors/research team. Cardiff University does not provide compensation for non‐negligent harm. 13. Sponsorship Cardiff University will act as sponsor for this study. 14. Funding The study is funded by two research grants: 4. Participant Selection The Cardiff HD Centre is an Enroll‐HD (previously Registry) site and many patients attending the clinic are enrolled in this study (REC no. 04/WSE05/89). Patients already enrolled to a global Enroll‐HD observational study will be invited to take part in this study. The progression of symptoms in these Enroll‐HD participants are monitored longitudinally. One of the optional components within the Enroll‐HD study is the giving of permission by participants to be contacted about other additional and affiliated HD research studies, and for their coded data to be accessed by researchers conducting HD related research. As such, a full clinical data set including full medical and medication history will be available for each research participant and this data may be used during the study. In addition, the investigators would like to gather the views of family members, friends and carers. Participants will be asked to provide consent so that the investigators can talk to their family member, friend or carer, who may be attending research visits with the participant, about their involvement in the study. If informed consent is obtained, via a participant dated consent form, the family member, friend or carer will be invited to be interviewed about the study. 7. Data Collection For the majority of assessment procedures, data will be collected on paper data collection forms and the results of the tests subsequently transferred to a secure online database. The data in the online database will be verified against the paper form to ensure data integrity. Original data collection sheets will be filed and stored securely in the TMF. For the semi‐structured interviews, questions will be asked orally by the researcher, audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Although some flexibility may be necessary to avoid the need for protocol amendments. A list of topics to be included in the interview schedule for participants and family members, friends or carers who attend the research visit with the participant include: ‐ How the intervention is perceived/was received? ‐ Expected or perceived impact on daily routine ‐ Expected or perceived impact on family members/ carers ‐ Overall expectations ‐ Expected or perceived acceptability (support or help required) ‐ Thoughts and views on the randomisation procedure ‐ Potential barriers to completing the intervention ‐ General views or comments on the cognitive training intervention 1. 18 month research grant from the Jacque and Gloria Gossweiler Foundation, awarded to Dr. Emma Yhnell (Lead Applicant), Prof. Anne Rosser, Prof. Monica Busse and Dr. Claudia Metzler‐Baddeley. 'Exploring cognitive training as a non‐pharmaceutical therapeutic intervention for people with Huntington's disease.' (funding start date: 1st April 2016, study end date: 30th September 2017). 2. 36 month fellowship award to Dr. Emma Yhnell from Health and Care Research Wales. 'Using computer based cognitive training to provide a personalised therapeutic intervention for people with Huntington's disease.' (funding start date: 1st October 2016, study end date: 30th September 2019). 8. Data Analysis As the proposed study is a feasibility study for the use of computerised cognitive training for people with HD, the study is not formally powered. The primary aim is that of feasibility, so eligibility, recruitment and acceptability of the study will all be evaluated. Adherence to the proposed cognitive training intervention and any adverse effects will also be reported. Therefore, crucial inferences will be made which will allow an estimation of parameters that can inform definitive and future trials in this specific patient population. 8.1. Statistical Analyses Summary statistics of demographics (age, gender, height and weight) and disease burden scores will be reported. Descriptive data will include an evaluation of eligibility, recruitment, retention rates and acceptability of, and adherence to the intervention, with 95% confidence intervals. The completion of outcome measures and assessments will also be reported. Graphical illustration will be used to check distributions of outcome data. Successful adherence to the intervention will be defined as having completed 12 weeks of the computerised cognitive training for a minimum of 3, 30 minute sessions per week. This is a feasibility study; thus an estimation of retention rates may be difficult with such as small sample size. Therefore, it is suggested that if retention rates are greater than 75%, the investigators will consider this intervention to be feasible. If the proportion retained is less than this but greater than 65%, the investigators will consider adjusting the intervention to increase this in future investigations. The qualitative work will help to establish why retention rates are as they are at the end of the study. A retention rate lower than this would require substantial changes to the intervention and therefore would require further piloting and feasibility studies. Changes in the outcome assessments in will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the baseline score of that variable in addition to the balancing variables (age and UHDRS TMS) as covariates. Data collection will be performed via HAPPYneuron software systems and initially on data collection forms before transfer to a database. Data completeness will be monitored at the point of collection; therefore, the investigators do not expect large amounts of missing data. As it is our intention to inform future confirmatory trials, the investigators will explore the feasibility of outcomes as applied in this trial and this population. The investigators will consider internal reliability of all outcome measures, as some have not been previously used in HD or applied to computerised cognitive training interventions. 15. Study Management The project will be managed by the CI Dr. Emma Yhnell, with the support of colleagues from the Cardiff HD Centre, including Ms. Hannah Furby, Prof. Monica Busse (SEWTU), Prof. Anne Rosser (Clinical Responsible for Care) and Dr. Claudia Metzler‐Baddeley (CUBRIC). In addition the CI will receive advisory support from members of SEWTU, in the form of monthly research meetings and email support for the duration of the project. The SEWTU advisory board includes: Dr Rachel Breen, Dr. Rebecca Playle, Mr. Gareth Watson and Dr. Lucy Brookes‐Howells. 9. Dissemination The research team are committed to disseminating the research findings to the general public and patient groups and will seek to present the results at patient open days, engagement events and outreach activities. Dissemination is a particular passion of the CI. Furthermore, in order to communicate the research widely, the results may be disseminated via social media, through newsletters and other patient engagement outlets in appropriate language and format for the general public to understand. If a participant indicates that they would like to be informed of the results of the trial a report of the findings will be sent to them at trial closure. Where results are presented, they will always be presented in such a way that data from individual participants cannot be identified. In addition to the significant public and patient outreach dissemination, the research findings will be written up for publication in a scientific journal. The results may also be presented at scientific meetings, or in talks at academic institutions. 10. Data Storage, Handling, Retention and Confidentiality All data will be stored within a firewall and password−protected computer system within a swipe−card secured building. Researchers associated with the study will have confidential access to files, which allow the matching of recorded data to participants. No data, whether paper or electronic, will leave Cardiff University sites without being completely anonymised, i.e., all identifiable data will be removed from the dataset. Any electronic files or disks will be stored on Cardiff University sites and electronically on Cardiff University systems. At the conclusion of the study identifiable data will be destroyed and non‐identifiable data will be archived, although it will still be accessible to the study team. Data will be archived for 15 years, in line with Cardiff University policies and procedures. Study data may be shared with the organisation funding the study. Where data leaves Cardiff University it will be strictly anonymised. Anonymised data may be shared with researchers at other organisations in the UK or overseas and it may be made publicly available for future research use. In the case of the data generated using HAPPYneuron systems, this data is captured centrally and stored outside of the Cardiff University systems and is therefore subject to HAPPYneuron's policies and procedures. However, a subset of this data will be extracted for use in the study and transferred on to Cardiff University systems as described above. All participant identification and referral procedures as well as procedures for data storage, processing and management will comply with the Data Protection Act 1998. Data will be kept for 15 years in line with Cardiff University's Research Governance Framework Regulations for clinical research. This data will be stored confidentially on password protected servers maintained on the Cardiff University Network. Data will be stored in locked cabinets and/or on secured computer hard‐drives (password protected) in an access controlled building and will be retained indefinitely. This is in compliance with the guidelines set by the Cardiff University Research Governance Framework. The confidentiality of participants will be preserved in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. All participants will be allocated an Enroll‐HD unique study number identifier and in the case of family members, friends or carers, they will be allocated a unique study number in relation to the participant. All data collected will be held in a linked anonymised form.
